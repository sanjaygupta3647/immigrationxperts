                            <h5 class="txt mt-4">Basic criteria</h5>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2">Investment starting at £2,000,000</p>
                            <h5 class="txt mt-4">Regarding the Tier 1 Investor Visa</h5>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2">The Tier 1 Investor Visa route has been closed as of February
                                17, 2022. Both new applications and moving from another category are not permitted.
                                Prior to that time, candidates may still apply for permanent residency (ILR), extend
                                their visas, and bring family members.</p>
                            <h5 class="txt mt-4">The benefits of a UK investment visa</h5>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2">With its robust economy, entrepreneurism, and high standard of
                                life, Great Britain has long been a popular destination for businesspeople from across
                                the globe. Many foreigners travel to the UK every year for job, study, and to launch new
                                businesses.</p>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2">Most of the time, in order to become a resident of the UK, you
                                must demonstrate your education and experience, speak at least basic English, and fulfil
                                other strict requirements set down by the UK immigration authorities. The fortunate
                                exception to this rule is those who are applying for a Tier 1 Investor Visa.</p>
                            <h5 class="txt mt-4">What is a Tier 1 Investor visa?</h5>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2">The UK Tier 1 investor visa is a visa designed for wealthy
                                individuals from other countries who wish to relocate to the United Kingdom. By
                                investing a minimum of £2 million, applicants can apply for indefinite leave to remain
                                (ILR) more quickly if they choose to invest a larger amount. The earliest time frame for
                                settling in the UK is two years, and it takes approximately five years to become a
                                British citizen.</p>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2">To be eligible for a Tier 1 Investor visa, individuals must
                                invest their money in a company or companies registered in the UK, pass due diligence
                                checks, and establish an investment account. In return for their substantial investment,
                                visa holders enjoy extensive freedom to pursue various activities within the UK. The
                                initial visa is issued for a period of three years and four months, and if the applicant
                                is not yet eligible to apply for ILR at that point, it can be extended for an additional
                                two years.</p>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2">The UK investor visa offers numerous advantages, which we will
                                now discuss.</p>
                            <h5 class="txt mt-4">Here are seven advantages of the UK investor visa:</h5>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2"><span>➤</span> Swift Application Process: The UK investor visa
                                offers one of the quickest application processes among UK visas. From submitting the
                                application to receiving the visa, the entire procedure takes no longer than three
                                months. Typically, the Home Office makes a decision within 15 days. By paying an
                                additional £500 for a priority service, you can expedite the process even further.
                            </p>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2"><span>➤</span> Inclusion of Family Members: Your spouse,
                                unmarried partner, and minor children can be included in your UK investor visa
                                application, allowing them to benefit from the visa along with you.</p>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2"><span>➤</span> No Work Experience, Education, or English Test
                                Required: Unlike many other visas, the UK investor visa does not necessitate
                                demonstrating work experience, providing proof of education, or taking an English
                                proficiency test.
                            </p>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2"><span>➤</span> Versatile Lifestyle: With the UK investor visa,
                                you and your family have the freedom to work, conduct business, study, or simply enjoy
                                the comforts and safety of everyday life in a modern European country. Your investment
                                grants you access to high standards of healthcare, education, and security.</p>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2"><span>➤</span> Profitable Investment Opportunities: Investing
                                in shares of UK companies can be financially rewarding. As the investor, you have the
                                autonomy to choose where to invest, remaining in control. When your visa expires or you
                                obtain indefinite leave to remain, you can sell the shares and recoup your investment
                                with potential gains.</p>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2"><span>➤</span> Visa Duration and Extensions: The UK investor
                                visa is valid for three years and four months if applied for outside the UK, and three
                                years if applied for within the country. It can be extended for an additional two years,
                                or you may apply for settlement immediately, depending on the amount you have invested.
                            </p>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2"><span>➤</span> Path to British Citizenship: If you invest more
                                than £5,000,000, you can apply for British citizenship after residing in Great Britain
                                for five years. This makes the UK investor visa one of the swiftest routes to obtaining
                                a UK passport.</p>
                            <h5 class="txt mt-4">What is prohibited when on an investment visa in the UK</h5>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2">In the UK, there are just a few restrictions on investors'
                                professional activities:</p>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2"><span>➤</span> Without the necessary training and/or
                                experience, they cannot practise medicine or dentistry in the UK.</p>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2"><span>➤</span> They are unable to make a living as professional
                                athletes or coaches since those occupations need a different type of visa.</p>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2"><span>➤</span> No matter what their employment, individuals are
                                not eligible to claim for social assistance.</p>
                            <h5 class="txt mt-4">Summary of Requirements for Tier 1 Investor Visa:</h5>

                            <p class="about-one__text-2"><span>➤</span> Background Checks: UK banks conduct background
                                checks on all potential clients for the applicant's benefit.</p>

                            <h5 class="txt mt-4">Options for Tier 1 Investor visa investments</h5>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2">The UK government is eager to bring in foreign capital for the
                                real economy. As a result, investors who apply for a UK Tier 1 Investor Visa after March
                                29, 2019, may only invest in shares of companies with UK registrations.</p>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2">After receiving your visa, you have three months to go to the
                                UK, transfer money to a local investing account, and purchase shares in the firms of
                                your choice.</p>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2">The necessary bare minimum is £2,000,000. The greater it is,
                                the quicker you'll be able to settle and become a British citizen.</p>
                            <h5 class="txt mt-4">You have the option to apply for an extension of your initial investor
                                visa in the UK for an additional two years, provided that you meet the following
                                requirements:</h5>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2"><span>➤</span> Within 90 days of obtaining your visa, you
                                arrived in the UK and purchased shares of UK companies worth at least £2 million.
                                Additionally, both you and any adult dependants accompanying you registered with the
                                police within seven days of arrival.</p>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2"><span>➤</span> Since entering the UK, you have not withdrawn
                                any funds from your investment portfolio. It is worth noting that if the value of your
                                shares has fallen below £2,000,000 during this period, you are not required to top it up
                                in order to extend your visa.</p>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2"><span>➤</span> Your spouse or partner, minor children, and any
                                children who have turned 18 since arriving in the UK on your initial investor visa can
                                apply to extend their visas alongside you.</p>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2"><span>➤</span> If you submitted your application before March
                                29, 2019, and invested in government bonds, you are eligible to extend your UK investor
                                visa.</p>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2"><span>➤</span> If you initially applied under the previous
                                regulations and invested £1,000,000, you can only extend your visa now if you invest an
                                additional £1,000,000 in shares of UK-registered companies.</p>
                            <h5 class="txt mt-4">Application for a UK visa: processing time</h5>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2">The process of preparing your application takes 1-2 weeks. We
                                then submit it together with all accompanying documentation. To get your fingerprints
                                and photo taken, all you have to do is visit a visa centre. In either 8 weeks (for
                                regular service) or 5 working days (for expedited service), a decision will be made.</p>
                            <h5 class="txt mt-4">Requesting ILR</h5>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2">You can apply for ILR in the United Kingdom after 2, 3, or 5
                                years of nonstop residence here, depending on your investment (see the chart above). All
                                of your family members, including your spouse, any children who are still minors, and
                                any children who turned 18 since you first applied, can settle with you at the same time
                                as long as they continue to depend on you financially.</p>
                            <h5 class="txt mt-4">Exceptions</h5>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2"><span>➤</span> If you made an investment before 29 March 2019
                                and have government bonds in your portfolio, you must file a claim for settlement by 6
                                April 2025.</p>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2"><span>➤</span> You must submit an application for ILR before 6
                                April 2022 if you invested £1,000,000 before 6 November 2014 and have previously
                                extended it a few times under the previous regulations. If for whatever reason you are
                                unable to do so, you may still submit an application to settle, but only if you expand
                                your investment portfolio to $2,000,000. Please keep in mind that a holding period of
                                (2, 3 or 5 years) will begin anew in this scenario.</p>
                            <h5 class="txt mt-4">ILR application requirements</h5>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2">To apply for Indefinite Leave to Remain (ILR), you must
                                demonstrate the following:</p>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2"><span>➤</span> Continuous presence in the UK: You need to
                                provide evidence that you have remained in the UK without any breaks exceeding 180 days
                                within a 12-month period since your initial entry.</p>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2"><span>➤</span> Financial stability: You should not have reduced
                                your portfolio by withdrawing funds.</p>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2"><span>➤</span> English language proficiency: Both you and any
                                adult dependants must have passed an English test at Level B1 or higher.</p>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2"><span>➤</span> Knowledge of life in the UK: You and all adult
                                dependants must have successfully passed the Life in the UK test.</p>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2"><span>➤</span> Rights and privileges: Acquiring ILR grants you
                                nearly the same rights as British citizens. Once you obtain settled status, you have the
                                option to reclaim any funds you had provided as part of the application. </p>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2"><span>➤</span> Additionally, after one year, you can apply for
                                naturalisation in the United Kingdom, which would allow you to obtain your first British
                                passport.</p>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2">British citizenship and passport eligibility depend on the
                                amount of investment made and the duration of residence in the UK. If an investment of
                                at least £5,000,000 is made, an application for a UK passport can be made after residing
                                in the country for 5 years. If the investment is less than £2,000,000, an application
                                for British citizenship can only be made after continuously residing in the British
                                Isles for 6 years. However, regardless of the investment amount, naturalisation is only
                                possible one year after settling in the UK.</p>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2">To qualify, certain requirements must be met. During the 5-year
                                period before applying, the total time spent outside the UK should not exceed 450 days,
                                and in the last year, while in a settled status, absences should not exceed 90 days.
                                Additionally, no criminal or civil offences should have been committed, and proficiency
                                in spoken English and passing the Life in the UK test are necessary.</p>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2">If all the aforementioned criteria are fulfilled, the
                                application for British citizenship will be processed and decided upon within 6-8 weeks.
                                Upon approval, a naturalisation certificate will be granted, which can then be used to
                                apply for a UK passport.</p>
