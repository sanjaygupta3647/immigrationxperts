                            <h5 class="txt mt-4">Denmark Immigration From India</h5>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2">The Denmark Green Card enables the owner to reside and do
                                business in Denmark. According to the Danish Green Card Scheme, an applicant is given a
                                residency and work permit after being evaluated on a "point scale" based on a few key
                                criteria.
                            </p>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2">It is not necessary to reapply for a work permit if a residence
                                permit is obtained under Denmark's green card programme. This is due to the fact that a
                                bearer of a green card may work in Denmark.
                            </p>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2">You must apply for a work and residency permit in Denmark
                                before you may start looking for employment there. The nation offers several types of
                                work permits. The top three are as follows:</p>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2"><span>➤</span> Fast-Track Scheme</p>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2"><span>➤</span> Pay Limit Scheme </p>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2"><span>➤</span> Positive List</p>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2">These choices include several visa categories including
                                research, wage cap, and more.</p>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2">The role determines how simple it is to obtain a visa. If you
                                are travelling to Denmark from India for a position where there is a talent shortage, it
                                will be simpler to obtain a visa. You can then submit an application for a Positive List
                                visa.</p>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2">If you are travelling to the nation on a job that pays much
                                more than the average income or if your employer has been recognised by the government
                                as an international employer, you will find it simple to have your Denmark visa from
                                India completed.
                            </p>
                            <h5 class="txt mt-4">Main reasons to move to Denmark:
                            </h5>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2"><span>➤</span> A well-balanced family and work-life</p>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2"><span>➤</span> Excellent business climate and
                            </p>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2"><span>➤</span> An efficient welfare state</p>
                            <h5 class="txt mt-4">What are the reasons for moving to Denmark?</h5>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2">Denmark, despite its robust economy, has not been immune to the
                                global financial crisis, which has had a negative impact on employment. Nevertheless,
                                Denmark will still rely on international recruitment, particularly for high-skilled
                                positions. As the market situation improves in the coming years, there will likely be a
                                continued demand for foreign workers in various job categories.
                            </p>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2">Individuals can obtain a residence permit to seek employment
                                and work in Denmark. The Green card scheme grants residence and work permits based on an
                                individual evaluation using a point system.
                            </p>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2">If you are granted a residence permit under the Green card
                                scheme, you will not need a separate work permit. This permit allows you to engage in
                                paid or unpaid work. However, it does not permit self-employment or running your own
                                business.</p>
                            <h5 class="txt mt-4">The program for obtaining a Green Card:</h5>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2">The green card programme uses a point system; applicants must
                                receive 100 points to be eligible, with points awarded for education, language
                                proficiency, and adaptability. Under the Green Card programme, you may be given a
                                first-time residence visa for a period of up to two years. You may submit an application
                                for a three-year extension prior to the expiration of this time frame.
                            </p>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2">If you earn at least the minimal amount (of the public and
                                private sectors) for new graduates with a Bachelor's degree within the last 12 months
                                prior to filing your application for an extension, your residence permit may be renewed.
                            </p>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2">The biggest urban cities in Denmark are Copenhagen, Aarhus,
                                Odense, Aalborg, and Frederiksberg.</p>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2">A scant 5.3 million persons, or 0.04% of the country's overall
                                population, are members of the Indian diaspora in Denmark. Most of the computer experts,
                                journalists, physicians, and proprietors of kiosks and restaurants in this neighbourhood
                                are from India. Around 7,500–8,000 Hindus of Tamil ancestry reside in Denmark.</p>
                            <h5 class="txt mt-4">Permanent Residency</h5>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2">You can apply for a permanent resident visa after eight years
                                of temporary residence in Denmark. In some cases, a four-year stay is necessary.</p>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2">You are free to apply for permanent residence at any time. The
                                time to apply does not have to be when your present residency permit expires. Your
                                application must be filed however before the expiration of your present residency
                                permit.</p>
                            <h5 class="txt mt-4">Eligibility Requirements</h5>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2">To meet the requirements</p>

                            <p class="about-one__text-2"><span>➤</span> Denmark, also known as the Kingdom of Denmark,
                                is a nation located in the northern European region of Scandinavia. It shares its
                                borders with Germany, Sweden, and Norway, and is surrounded by the Baltic and North
                                Seas. Denmark operates under a constitutional monarchy with a parliamentary system of
                                government.</p>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2"><span>➤</span> As a member state of the European Union, Denmark
                                has been recognized for its peaceful environment, ranking second in the Global Peace
                                Index survey, just behind New Zealand. Additionally, Denmark has been acknowledged as
                                the world's least corrupt country.</p>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2"><span>➤</span> The city of Copenhagen has been acclaimed as the
                                most livable city worldwide by Monocle magazine. Approximately 9% of Denmark's
                                population consists of individuals with foreign citizenship, with a significant portion
                                having Scandinavian roots and others representing various nationalities.</p>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2"><span>➤</span> Denmark has an estimated population of 5.5
                                million people. Danish is the official language spoken across the country, while English
                                and German are the most commonly spoken foreign languages.</p>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2">Notably, Denmark boasts a GDP per capita income higher than
                                that of many European countries and approximately 15-20% higher than that of the United
                                States.
