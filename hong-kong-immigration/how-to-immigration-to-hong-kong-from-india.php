                                with an objective to attract highly talented or skilled individuals to settle in Hong

                                of each selection exercise are published on the website of Immigration Department. As it
                                takes considerable amount of time to process applications, they would be considered
                                under processing until the applicant would receive a notification on refusal by the

                                exercise are sent an “Approval-in-principle letter”. Such applicants then come to Hong

                                along with the application to Immigration Department for verification purpose. In this

                                does not guarantee approval applicant’s entry to or their settlement in Hong Kong under
                                the QMAS Scheme. </p>
                            <h5 class="txt mt-4">Stage 5: Issue of entry permit/visa</h5>
