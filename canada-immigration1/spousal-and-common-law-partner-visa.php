                                                    Initially introduced as a pilot program in 2014, the open work

                                                    impact on families across Canada. In July 2020, IRCC announced the
                                                    extension of this program with the intention of making it a

                                                    Canada (thus making Inland sponsorship an alternative). The Outland
                                                    pathway may have a potential advantage of shorter processing times
                                                    in some cases. However, IRCC has implemented measures to reduce

                                                    As Canadian immigration applications can be intricate, it is crucial
                                                    to ensure that no information or document is missing. A single

                                                    seeking assistance from a Regulated Canadian Immigration Consultant
