                                prairie provinces of Canada. Talking about the economy of Alberta, in 2013 Alberta’s per
                                capita GDP exceeded that of the United States, Norway or Switzerland, thus being one of
                                the strongest economies in the world. This economy is mainly supported by the burgeoning
                                petroleum industry and to in minimum extent, agriculture, and technology.</p>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2">Province of Alberta is looking for immigrants with the skills
                                and work experience that is required by the local labor market as it is facing a
                                shortage of capable individuals. To fill this gap of skilled labor, the provincial
                                government of Alberta has a special agreement with the Immigration, Refugees &
                                Citizenship Canada (IRCC) that allows them to nominate the skilled and capable
                                immigrants for permanent residency in the province. This immigration pathway is known as
                                the Alberta Immigrant Nominee Program (AINP).</p>

                                support. Alberta PNP is mainly broken into three main immigration streams:</p>
