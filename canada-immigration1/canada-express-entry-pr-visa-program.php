                            <h1 class="section-title__title">Express Entry Program</h1>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2">Express Entry program was launched in 2015, and since then its
                                tremendous success has made it worthy of acclaims. Before the advent of this immigration
                                program, it was very difficult to apply for a Canada PR visa. The Canada permanent
                                resident visa process often created mass confusion, thus leaving applicants frustrated
                                due to loss of both time and money.</p>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2">Since the arrival of the Express Entry program, it has become
                                fairly easy to apply for Canada pr visa. Now the economic route for Canada PR process is
                                streamlined which results in less confusion and faster processing of applications.</p>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2">Ageing population’ is a notoriously difficult problem to deal
                                with, especially for a country like Canada. Due to a low birth rate, number of old
                                people in Canada are growing at a disproportionate rate, as compared to young people.
                                This is creating a gap which is increasing the financial burden on the Government.</p>

                            <h2 class="txt mt-4">Immigration Creates Winners and Losers</h2>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2">Ever since the US has adopted strict immigration policies,
                                companies have started hiring in Canada. According to a new Envoy Global Survey, 80
                                percent of Employers expected that the number of foreign employees in their company will
                                stay the same or grow in 2020. Out of all the employers surveyed, 63 percent are
                                increasing their presence in Canada. To do so, they are either transferring their
                                workers to Canada or directly hiring foreign nationals in Canada.</p>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2">It can be inferred from this survey that employers won’t stop
                                innovating, and as a result would hire foreign nationals in other countries. As more
                                people apply for Canada PR visa, the likelihood of retaining such economic benefits will
                                increase.</p>

                            <p class="about-one__text-2">As mentioned above, Express Entry program has greatly minimized
                                confusion, decreased processing time and facilitated immigration. In the 2018 annual
                                report to Parliament on immigration, it is noted that Canada took in 65,417 new
                                permanent residents via the Express Entry Program in 2017. Further, 12,531 immigrants
                                were admitted though Express Entry PNP (Provincial Nominee Programs.)</p>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2">In the first quarter of 2019, Canada issued 21,200 invitation
                                to apply to eligible candidates. This is an increase of 3,700 from the first quarter of
                                2018. Among the first quarter of the previous 4 years, this quarter witnessed the
                                highest number of ITAs issued. Further, for the past 6 draws the average CRS score is
                                448.83.</p>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2">After redefining immigration, this program can redefine your
                                life. So take in a dive to learn more about the process, processing time, requirements
                                and eligibility criteria.</p>

                            Provincial Nomination</h2>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2">Provincial nominations provide 600 additional points, which you
                                may know is much more than the usual cutoff. Therefore, nomination from a province will
                                ensure that you clear the CRS threshold.</p>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2">There are many provincial immigration streams, however applying
                                via express entry is the easiest. The primary reason behind this is that once you’ve
                                submitted your profile in the express entry pool, provinces will be able to view and
                                assess it. As a result, they will be able to identify the candidates they want to
                                nominate. For instance, if they like your profile and deem you eligible, then they’ll
                                provide you an EOI (Expression of Interest.) You can either accept or reject this EOI.
                                However, if you choose to accept, you will have to live and work in the province that
                                provided you the nomination.</p>
                            <h2 class="txt mt-4">Canada PR Express Entry Processing Time 2024</h2>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2">The IRCC usually processes an application within 6 months from
                                the date it was submitted in the express entry pool. Once you submit the profile, it
                                will be included in all subsequent draws and is valid for 12 months. After this you can
                                submit your profile again.</p>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2">You will receive an ITA, only if you receive a score that is
                                more than the CRS cut-off for at least one subsequent draw till your profile is valid.
