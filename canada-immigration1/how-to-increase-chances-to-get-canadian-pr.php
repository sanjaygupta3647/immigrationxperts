                            <p class="about-one__text-2">Here’s some important advice for Express Entry candidates to
                                help them improve their Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS) score and receive a Canadian
                                PR</p>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2">Express Entry is one of the most prominent and fastest ways to
                                Canadian Permanent Residence (PR). But only those candidates with the highest CRS score
                                receives an invitation to apply (ITA) to apply for the Canadian Permanent Residency.
                                Since, applicants in the Express Entry pool have to compete with each other to be
                                invited, therefore it is important to know the various ways to increase your CRS score.
                            </p>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2">If you have already submitted your Express Entry profile and
                                your CRS score is lower than what is in demand, you have a range of options to improve
                                your CRS score. This page will help you recognize the best options available for
                                increasing your total CRS score. Whether you only need a just few points to achieve your
                                desired score or require to get a big boost to receive your invitation to apply, we will
                                help you know the best way(s) that will work for you. </p>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2">To find out the figure of the desired CRS score that is
                                required to get an invitation to apply, check out the latest list of the Express Entry
                                Draw </p>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2"><span>Understanding the matrix of Comprehensive Ranking System:
                                    How is CRS score calculated?</span> </p>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2">After you have determined your eligibility requirements under
                                one of the Express Entry aligned immigration streams, have created an Express Entry
                                profile and been given a CRS score, it might seem that you just only have to wait to
                                receive your invitation to apply but that will happen only if you have been given a high
                                CRS score. In the absence of which, the wait could be long!</p>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2">There exist various opportunities to improve your overall rank
                                among other candidates under the Comprehensive Ranking System in the Express Entry Pool.
                                You can work upon grabbing these opportunities because even if you have created your
                                Express Entry profile but since the CRS is an ever-changing system and your score is not
                                locked or finalized yet – you can take all the necessary steps to improve it. </p>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2">Although some improvements will only increase your CRS score up
                                to a few points, but still this slight increase could make a huge difference. On the
                                other hand, some improvements can bring you as many as 600 additional points in your
                                total CRS score, which in turn would give guarantee that you will receive an invitation
                                to apply in the next draw from the Express Entry pool. </p>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2"><span>Checklist: Claim the required points and make yourself
                                    eligible</span> </p>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2">There could still be certain areas of the CRS score where you
                                might have missed claiming the necessary points that you can get. Take a detailed
                                overview of the list given below and make sure that you have claimed points across all
                                factors that are applicable under your individual profile. </p>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2"><span>Siblings in Canada</span> </p>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2">Check if you or your common-law partner or spouse have a
                                brother or a sister residing in Canada, either as a permanent resident or citizen of
                                Canada. This relationship can exist through blood, marriage, adoption or common-law
                                partnership. If this is the case, then you just have to prove the necessary relationship
                                and your total CRS score can increase by a total 15 points. </p>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2"><span>Education</span> </p>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2">This particular strategy is aimed for candidates applying for
                                the Canadian PR as Federal Skilled Trades Class (FSTC) and Canadian Experience Class
                                (CEC). Unlike candidates applying under the Federal Skilled Worker Class (FSWC), the
                                FSTC and CEC candidates are not required to provide an Educational Credential Assessment
                                (ECA) or any academic documents from a Canadian university or college to become eligible
                                for the Express Entry Program. This simply implies that along with education, who can
                                claim up to 200 CRS points. Educational documents are worth 150 points in their own and
                                a maximum of 50 points can be gained more along with credible language proficiency test
                                scores and Canadian work experience. </p>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2">While creating your Express Entry Profile, you are required to
                                mention all your valid education that you have completed till date. Even if you hold a
                                one-year diploma that was completed eight years ago but that not relevant with respect
                                to your current job, then also you can claim points on this in your Express Entry
                                Profile. You would be needed to obtain an ECA report for all your educational
                                credentials (unless the education is not completed in Canada). Express Entry System
                                awards points for your education regardless of the field of study and whether or not the
                                degree or diploma relates with your current work. </p>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2"><span>Second Language </span> </p>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2">You have the option to claim points for both French and English
                                in your total CRS score. If you skilled in both languages, then make sure to appear for
                                an approved language tests for both French and English to ensure that you are getting
                                extra points on your language abilities. Moreover, there are bonus points available for
                                bilingual candidates and there are certain PNP streams that give high priority to
                                French-speakers. </p>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2">If you have language abilities in both French and English, then
                                do not miss this opportunity to increase your overall CRS score. </p>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2">However, if you have made all the necessary efforts to claim
                                your points across eligibility criteria mentioned but your score is still below the
                                required competitive range, then must consider making a genuine effort to increase your
                                overall CRS score using the strategies described below. </p>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2"><span>Instant ways to increase your CRS score</span> </p>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2">Here are some important recommendations for a reliable way to
                                increase your overall CRS score. This can be done in a matter of few months if not
                                weeks, if you are determined to put honest time and effort needed to move towards your
                                final goal. </p>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2"><span>Reappear for your language tests</span> </p>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2">If you have not yet achieved your desired language test scores,
                                then this particular option could be a faster and short-term way to get that competitive
                                CRS score. </p>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2">The language ability of a candidate is worth up to a maximum of
                                260 points and up to 270 points in total when applying along with a spouse. Therefore,
                                language abilities and skills (English and/or French) are not only the most crucial
                                human capital factor under the Express Entry System but it can also help you gain
                                incremental gains on your overall CRS score. </p>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2">Additional points are accumulated for even a slight improvement
                                of 0.5 points under each of the language abilities, that is, speaking, listening,
                                reading and writing. This particular threshold is when a candidate is able to achieve a
                                Canadian Language Benchmark or CLB level 9 under each ability. This is mainly because
                                getting a CLB 9 under each language ability triggers an exponential increase in the
                                total points under the skills transferability factor (this particular factor also takes
                                into consideration the points awarded for your educational credentials and total work
                                experience). One small increase your language ability score can lead to a giant leap in
                                your total CRS score. </p>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2">Skills transferability factors has a total worth of 100 points
                                and therefore you can make appropriate efforts to gain as many points as you can under
                                this category. </p>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2">To reach at the level of CLB 9 on IELTS General Training
                                examination, you would need to achieve the following minimum score under given
                                abilities:</p>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2"><span>➤ </span> Listening: 8.0</p>

                                General test, you would be required to achieve a minimum score equivalent to 9 under
                                each of the four abilities. </p>

                                these options could take you few months while others could even take you some years, but
                                they will be an unprecedented gain in long-term planning.</p>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2"><span>Gain more professional experience </span> </p>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2">If you have less than three years of full-time or an equivalent
                                amount of part-time work experience while working outside Canada, then you are suggested
                                to gain more work experience. While your total work experience won’t benefit you under
                                the human capital factors but it would certainly reward considerable points in the
                                skills transferability combinations. </p>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2">The objective of remaining employed is even more important for
                                immigrants that are currently working in Canada on a work visa. This is because they can
                                gain additional points under the Canadian work experience category, if able to maintain
                                legalized work status for the entire term. </p>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2"><span>Provincial Nominee Programs</span> </p>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2">You can gain as high as 600-points increase in your total CRS
                                score if you have been nominated by a particular province in Canada.</p>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2">IRCC is increasingly giving additional preferences to the
                                provinces under the PNP stream. In turn, these provinces also look towards the Express
                                Entry pool and selects certain candidates that would contribute towards the economical
                                development of the province through their in-demand skill-sets and work experience. </p>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2">Over the past few months, Canadian provinces are using Express
                                Entry-aligned PNP streams in dynamic ways. For instance, Ontario has targeted specific
                                professionals, particularly in the Information Technology (IT) sector; Saskatchewan and
                                Nova Scotia have also opened PNP streams for individuals across a wide range of
                                occupations, which does not require a prior job offer; British Columbia has continued to
                                welcome candidates through its unique immigration system; Manitoba and Alberta also have
                                their own immigration programs that are associated with the Express Entry System; and
                                similarly other provinces are also issuing nominations certificates to eligible and
                                skilled candidates from the Express Entry pool. </p>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2">Six hundred points are a lot! The points are available to
                                candidates who either apply for a Provincial Nominee Program individually or along with
                                their Express Entry Profile. Check out the eligibility requirements for every province,
                                under the each of their individual PNP streams and fetch the required points. </p>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2"><span>Complete one more educational program </span> </p>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2">This indeed is a long-term strategy that can help you increase
                                your CRS score. However, gaining more education can definitely help you increase the
                                required score under the Express Entry System. This is because you receive CRS points
                                not only for your academic degrees and diploma but also gain appoints across the skill
                                transferability factor of the CRS. </p>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2">You can fetch a maximum of 100 points under the skill
                                transferability factor. Therefore, to maximize your CRS score under this section, on the
                                basis of your education, you would be recommended to complete at least the following
                                level of education:</p>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2">Two or more post-secondary educational credentials, and at
                                least one should be for a program pursued for a period of three-years or longer. </p>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2">In case you have already completed your bachelor’s degree, you
                                can enroll yourself in another one-year study program as this will help you gain extra
                                points under the skill transferability factor section. Although taking up an additional
                                one or two-year educational program would take long but it will be a worthwhile
                                investment if you have the intention to immigrate to Canada. </p>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2"><span>Move through a Canadian job offer</span> </p>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2">In order to claim certain points under the job offer received
                                from Canada in the Express Entry System, the job offer should meet strict set of
                                requirements. Although the advantage of obtaining a job offer, that will contribute
                                towards your CRS score is not as significant as it was once when a candidate used to get
                                600 points but now gets only 50 CRS points, still getting a qualifying job offer is an
                                important factor. </p>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2"><span>Take help from your spouse or partner to improve your CRS
                                    score</span> </p>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2"><span>Spouse/Partner Factors</span> </p>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2">If you are planning to immigrate to Canada along with your
                                spouse or common-law partner, then you should be aware that you can claim a maximum of
                                20 points based on your spouse/partner’s language ability. Additionally, their education
                                level and work experience gained in Canada is worth 10 points for each of the partner.
                                This makes a total of 40 points that can be claimed under your spouse or partner’s
                                factors. </p>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2">However, even if you apply as a single applicant, then these 40
                                points can still be distributed across various other factors in our own profile. Single
                                applicants have to simply claim these points under their own abilities. </p>
