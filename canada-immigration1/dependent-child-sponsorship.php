                            <p class="about-one__text-2">The Canadian government is deeply dedicated to maintaining
                                family unity and thus permits parents to sponsor their dependent children for
                                immigration to Canada.</p>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2">A parent who meets the eligibility criteria to be a sponsor can
                                apply for their child to become a permanent resident in Canada, provided the child meets
                                the definition of a dependent. </p>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2">Canada’s family-class immigration program permits the
                                sponsorship of various relatives, including children, spouses, common-law/conjugal
                                partners, parents, and grandparents, with family-class immigration accounting for
                                approximately 25% of all new permanent residents admitted into Canada annually.</p>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2">The likelihood of a child being a Canadian citizen is high if
                                they were born in Canada or if one of their parents is a citizen of Canada. To confirm
                                eligibility, one can use Canada’s citizenship tool. To be eligible for sponsorship, the
                                sponsoring parent and the dependent child must meet the requirements established by
                                Immigration, Refugees, and Citizenship Canada (IRCC).</p>
                            <h5 class="txt mt-4">What requirements are needed for a parent to sponsor their child’s
                                immigration to Canada?</h5>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2">To be considered as a sponsor, a person must meet two
                                requirements: they must be 18 years old or above, and they must hold either Canadian
                                citizenship or permanent residency status.</p>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2">Sponsors must commit to fulfilling the essential requirements
                                of their intended sponsored person and sign a pledge to offer financial aid to their
                                sponsored family member after they acquire permanent residency. Furthermore, they must
                                reimburse any social assistance payments obtained by the sponsored family member
                                throughout the pledge.</p>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2">Some circumstances exist that could make a parent unqualified
                                to act as a sponsor for their child:</p>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2"><span>➤</span> If the sponsoring parent became a Canadian
                                permanent resident less than five years ago and has no intention of living in Canada
                                with the sponsored child upon their permanent residency.</p>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2"><span>➤</span> If the sponsoring parent is a permanent resident
                                of Canada but resides outside the country, except for Canadian citizens who can apply
                                for sponsorship from any country with the intent to live in Canada with the sponsored
                                relative.</p>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2"><span>➤</span> If the sponsoring parent is receiving social
                                assistance for reasons other than disability.</p>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2"><span>➤</span> If the sponsoring parent is incarcerated or has
                                a criminal record, particularly for offenses committed against relatives.</p>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2">Typically, the parent who is sponsoring does not need to
                                demonstrate evidence of their financial earnings. Nevertheless, if the child who is
                                being sponsored has their dependent children, then the sponsoring parent must satisfy a
                                specific income criterion.</p>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2">If you reside in Quebec and intend to support a child, it is
                                important to acknowledge that you need to fulfill the immigration sponsorship criteria
                                of Quebec along with the prerequisites stated in this piece.</p>
                            <h3 class="txt mt-4">Super Visa</h3>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2">Some potential sponsors may face obstacles in applying for the
                                Parent and Grandparent Program, either because they didn’t receive an invitation or
                                because they prefer a faster process to bring their elderly relatives to Canada.
                                Fortunately, there is an alternative option available. </p>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2">Through the Super Visa program, parents and grandparents of
                                Canadian citizens or permanent residents can have extended stays in Canada, with the
                                possibility of staying for up to two years upon their first entry. The Super Visa is
                                valid for up to a decade, allowing its holders to return to Canada multiple times during
                                that period.</p>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2">The Super Visa is not a program that offers permanent
                                residence. Those who apply for it must have their medical insurance and are not allowed
                                to work in Canada unless they have specific authorization. Despite these restrictions,
                                the processing times are relatively fast, allowing families to reunite in Canada more
                                quickly than through the Parent and Grandparent Program. Additionally, applicants do not
                                need to wait for an invitation to apply; as long as they meet the eligibility
                                requirements, they can apply at any time and potentially be approved to come to Canada.
                            </p>
                            <h5 class="txt mt-4">What are the qualifications that must be met for a child to be
                                sponsored for immigration to Canada?</h5>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2">Initially, it is necessary to confirm whether your offspring
                                fulfills Canada’s criteria to be considered a dependent. There exist two approaches to
                                prove the dependent status:</p>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2"><span>➤</span> The child must be younger than 22 years old and
                                not married or living with a partner.</p>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2"><span>➤</span> The child must be 22 years old or older and have
                                a mental or physical condition that makes them unable to support themselves financially.
                                Additionally, they must have relied on their parents for financial support before
                                turning 22 years old.</p>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2">To qualify for sponsorship, you must either be sponsoring your
                                child or the child of your partner. If you are sponsoring your partner’s child who is
                                not your own, you must also be sponsoring your partner. </p>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2">It is important to note that there is a different procedure for
                                sponsoring adopted children in Canada. To determine if your child is eligible for
                                sponsorship, you can use the IRCC’s tool to determine if they meet the criteria to be
                                considered a dependent.</p>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2">To immigrate to Canada as a sponsored family member, it is
                                important not to have any inadmissibility issues such as past criminal convictions or
                                medical conditions that may endanger the health and safety of the Canadian public.
                                However, it’s worth noting that sponsored family members won’t be denied entry solely on
                                the grounds of their medical conditions being too costly for the Canadian healthcare
                                system.</p>
                            <h5 class="txt mt-4">What is the process for sponsoring a child for immigration to Canada?
                            </h5>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2">The process of sponsoring a child for Canadian immigration
                                consists of two parts. Firstly, the applicant needs to demonstrate their eligibility as
                                a sponsor. Secondly, they must provide evidence that the child meets the criteria for
                                Canadian permanent residency sponsorship. The IRCC’s Guide 5525 offers information on
                                the family sponsorship application process that can be useful for applicants in
                                preparing their application.</p>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2">It’s important to be aware that the requirements for family
                                sponsorship applications differ depending on the country. To find out about the specific
                                requirements, applicants should visit IRCC’s family sponsorship application page and
                                provide their details. IRCC will then produce the relevant checklists, forms, and
                                instructions related to sponsoring the child.</p>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2">The family sponsorship applications are not online, so they
                                must be completed in hard copy and sent to IRCC in a single envelope by mail or courier.
                                Sponsoring a child requires a fee of CAD 150, and the processing time depends on the
                                country where the sponsored child resides.</p>
                            <h5 class="txt mt-4">Do you want to sponsor children who live within or outside of your
                                local area?</h5>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2">The phrases “inland” and “outland” are frequently used to
                                describe applications for spousal sponsorship, even though they are not officially used
                                by IRCC. “Inland” refers to cases where the sponsored spouse is residing within Canada,
                                while “outland” applies to situations where the sponsored spouse is living outside
                                Canada. </p>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2">However, these terms are not applicable for sponsoring a child
                                for Canadian immigration, as all sponsorship applications for children are processed by
                                a visa office in Canada.</p>
                            <h5 class="txt mt-4">The concepts of family sponsorship and Express Entry are being
                                discussed</h5>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2">Express Entry, along with several other immigration programs
                                for economic classes in Canada, permits parents and children to apply for permanent
                                resident status concurrently. This implies that if an individual meets the requirements
                                for an Express Entry program, they can simply include their spouse/partner and any
