                            <p class="about-one__text-2">The Quebec Immigrant Investor Program is not open for accepting
                                new application between the period November 1, 2019 and July 1, 2020.</p>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2">The Quebec Immigrant Investors Program is one and only
                                immigration program launched by the provincial government of Canada that is specifically
                                designed to attract foreign investors. Immigrant investors that have a net worth
                                equivalent to a minimum amount of CAD 2 million can apply for the permanent residence
                                visa of Canada and making an investment using the Quebec Immigrant Investor Program.
                            </p>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2">Although Quebec is predominantly a French-speaking province,
                                but it not mandatory for the applicant to be proficient in the language to apply under
                                the Quebec Immigrant Investor Program. However, French language proficiency could be
                                considered as one of the important factors while selecting your profile for nomination
                                under Quebec Immigrant Investor Program.</p>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2">The Quebec Immigrant Investor Program could be described as
                                passive in nature, which implies that the applicants are not required to start or
                                actively operate a business in the province of Quebec. </p>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2">Successful applicants are sent a selection certificate from the
                                province of Quebec to immigrate to Canada, which enables them to obtain the permanent
                                residence permit of Canada after passing the medical and criminality exams taken by the
                                federal immigration authorities. </p>
                            <h5 class="txt mt-4">Benefits of Quebec Immigrant Investor Program</h5>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2">The Quebec Immigrant Investor Program is the only investor
                                immigration stream of the Canadian Government which offers the selected candidates an
                                array of advantages. Unlike some business investor immigration programs that exists for
                                international countries, for instance the EB-5 program of the United States government
                                which requires the applicant to generate a specific quota of jobs in a specific period
                                of time, the Quebec Immigrant Investor Program does not have any such eligibility
                                requirement. </p>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2">In addition to this, the Quebec Immigrant Investor Program also
                                provides permanent residency of Canada immediately after initial landing and therefore
                                does not involve any intermediate temporary visa grant. The applicants are also allowed
                                to include their immediate family members within the application and therefore obtain a
                                permanent residence visa of Canada for their dependents as well. </p>

                                be included in the application under the same status as that of the main applicant. </p>
