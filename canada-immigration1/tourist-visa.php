                            <p class="about-one__text-2">Canada has always been one country listed in the bucket list
                                for countries to visit of almost every individual. It’s cool as cucumber weather, scenic
                                beauty, snowfall and of course the biggest attraction – Niagara Falls has always
                                attracted tourists from all over the world. Considering the physical man made
                                attractions combined aesthetically with natural beauties the country receives hordes of
                                tourist visa applications. Many of them get accepted, however, some receive rejection
                                due to some ineligibility within the application. To ensure that you apply for the visa
                                with all the right details we have done the homework for you and illustrated all the
                                required information below.</p>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2">Foreign applicants having visa exempt will require ETA
                                (Electronic Travel Authorization)in order to fly or go through Canada. Individuals with
                                a legal and active Canadian Visa as well as US citizens are the only exceptions for this
                                new mode of entry. ETA cannot be applied by certain individuals who are basically
                                Canadian citizens having permanent residence or dual citizenship.</p>

                            <p class="about-one__text-2">Considering that this change was brought in just now, there is
                                a leniency period ending 9th November for travelers to reach Canada or go through the
                                country without ETA application in hand. For more information on this application click
                                on the following link – questions about applying for an eTA</p>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2">It is a good habit to apply for ETA as soon as possible.
                                Although most applicants get their ETA approved within few minutes, however, as times it
                                might take some time so it better to be prepared much in advance. Requirement and
                                approval of ETA depends on the situation or on the residential status of the travelling
                                individuals.</p>

                                visa-required countries and territories will require a document called Visitor visa
                                which is also considered to be the temporary resident visa for Canada. It is an official
                                document of Canada which is attached to the passport of the traveler that accords
                                permission to step into Canada.</p>
                            <h3 class="txt mt-4">Conditions Required to be met with Visa</h3>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2">Traveler can garner either multiple entry visa or single entry
                                visa both of which are accorded for specific time period and becomes unusable after
                                their expiration. Under multiple entry visa, the travelers can visit Canada off and on
                                for period specified on the document which generally stretches to 6 months. They do not
                                need to apply again for this document for every time they wish to enter Canada. The
                                document comes with the validity of 10 years or a month before the expiration of the
                                passport.</p>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2">On the other hand, single entry visa holders are allowed to
                                enter only once in Canada. Excluding trips to the US, St. Pierre and Miquelon, once the
                                traveler leaves the country he or she will be required to apply for new visa in order to
                                enter back into Canada.</p>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2">The visa can be applied for either online or by filling in the
                                application on paper and then submitting it to VAC (Visa Application Centre). In case
                                the traveler is applying for the visa on paper, it is recommended to submit the
                                application with a staff member of VAC personally as the staff member can go through the
                                application and ensure all the details are filled in correctly with correct amount of
                                money as well.</p>
                            <h3 class="txt mt-4">Imperative Travel Documents for Tourist Visa</h3>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2">The traveler will need to carry proper documents in order to
                                travel either to or through Canada for himself / herself and any other accompanying
                                individual like a child.</p>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2">Companies providing reliable transportation to Canada like
                                airlines ensure that the traveler is carrying all the required documents which are valid
                                as well as active. In case the traveler is not carrying the said documents he or she can
                                be delayed to board or not allowed to board the flight at all. There are certain
                                documents which are not considered authentic and are not entertained by the authorities.
                                These documents cannot accord traveler with entry into Canada and are illustrated below
                                for the information:</p>

                            <p class="about-one__text-2">Some travelers are not allowed to enter into Canada which makes
                                them inadmissible. Several reasons and criteria result an individual to become
                                inadmissible like full or partial involvement in organized crime, human right violations
                                or criminal activity.There are non-threatening reasons as well that make a person unable

                            <h3 class="txt mt-4">Application Processing under Tourist Visa</h3>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2">Once the application for the visa has been sent to appropriate
                                authority, the visa office will further go through the application in order to make sure
                                that all the required documents are duly attached and the form is completed properly. In
                                case the form is found to be incomplete or some document is not authenticated for
                                properly, then the application will be returned back and rejected.</p>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2">In the scenario wherein the form is complete and properly
                                attached with required documents visa office will ask the applicant for further process
                                as mentioned below:</p>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2"><span>Medical Exam:</span>At times travelers are asked to

                                instruction will be forwarded by the Visa center. In case of Medical exam, it is quite
                                possible of delay in garnering the required visa as the applicant will first need to set
                                appointments with required doctors, go for those appointments and then further more time
                                will be taken by the doctors to send in the required results to IRCC.</p>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2"><span>Verification by Police and Subsequent

                                get a Police certificate for himself and any other family member, under or above the age
                                of 18 years, who will be accompanying him or her to Canada. If this certificate is
                                required, it will be intimated from the visa office itself.</p>

                                might contact the applicant for an interview if he deems it necessary. Although most of

                                applicant will be returned to them. However, the original bank statements are not
                                returned.</p>
