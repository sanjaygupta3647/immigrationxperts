                            <p class="about-one__text-2">Quebec is one of the ten provinces of Canada and is the second
                                most populous province after Ontario. It has a predominantly French-speaking population,
                                with French being the sole provincial official language. Quebec has an advanced,
                                market-based and open economy. The economy of the province has undergone a tremendous
                                change over the last decade, with the firm ground in the knowledge economy. It has one
                                of the highest growth rates of gross domestic product (GDP) in Canada.</p>

                            <p class="about-one__text-2">To keep in pace with the growing economy in the province,
                                Quebec has to fill the gap of skilled individuals in the labor market. Quebec has a
                                special agreement with the Immigration, Refugees & Citizenship Canada (IRCC) that will
                                allow them to nominate the immigrants with required skills and work experience to live
                                in the province as a permanent resident. This immigration pathway for skilled immigrants
                                is known as the Quebec Skilled Worker Program.</p>

                                to have its own set of rules for selecting the immigrants who will be able to adapt well
                                to living in the province.</p>
