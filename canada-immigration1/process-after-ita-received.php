In such circumstances, the candidate profile will remain “active” in the Express Entry pool for the remaining days under the validity period and therefore the candidate would be considered for subsequent draws or rounds of invitation, if they continue to meet the MEC.&nbsp;</span></p>

										</div>
										<p><span>In this case, the candidate fails to submit a completed APR within the given 60 days period of time after receiving the ITA and decline the ITA in their online account within the given duration. In this case, the ITA will expire and the applicant will no longer be considered for future Express Entry rounds of invitation. To re-enter in to the Express Entry Pool, the candidate is required to create a new profile using their online account and will be re-assessed for the MEC at that point of time.</span></p>
										<p><b>Note: </b><span>It is the applicants’ responsibility to keep a frequent check on their online account. IRCC never grants any extension on the 60-calendar-day deadline period for submitting a completed APR. It will never be considered as a valid reason for extension of deadline, in case the applicant claims that they have forgot to check their online account or have not read their ITA letter. </span></p>
