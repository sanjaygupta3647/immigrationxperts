                                One of the major advantages of studying in Australia for students from India is the
                                ability to work up to 40 hours every two weeks if they are enrolled in a full-time
                                degree course there.The estimated minimum wage is 17 dollars an hour, and basic

                                handsomely. With this, students can cover their living expenditures, food costs, and

                <p class="about-one__text-2">After deciding on Australia as your international study location, you
                    should concentrate on the following critical phase in your study abroad trip: picking the ideal
                    course. Although it can seem simple, keep in mind that this is a crucial step for your employment in
                    Australia. You must pick a curriculum with solid potential for growth in Australia; else, you risk
                    having trouble finding a job you’ll like or obtaining resident status. You must begin looking for a
                    course to enroll in that will fit your interests or skills and have a broad professional scope (in
                    the market) in Australia if you want to avoid all these potential consequences.</p>
                <h5 class="txt mt-4">Human Resources</h5>
                <p class="about-one__text-2">The Human Resources (HR) industry is now expanding quickly and has the
                    potential to provide you with a wide range of employment opportunities, not only in Australia, but
                    outside as well. Approachable and analytic people are the best candidates for this position and can
                    enroll in a course in this area for impressive career advancement.</p>
                <h5 class="txt mt-4">Medical Or Nursing</h5>
                <p class="about-one__text-2">In Australia, medical practitioners are paid exceptionally well, if not the
                    best. One of the most acceptable options for pursuing a degree in Australia might be the challenging
                    industry, but you might need some extra cash to complete the task.By now, we are all aware of how
                    essential healthcare professionals are to society. There will be a considerable shortage of nurses
                    compared to demand. Nursing is the ideal profession for you if you desire a job that is intriguing,
                    demanding, and impacts people’s lives. A licensed nurse in Australia may expect to make an average
                    salary of $73,000 per year and have many career options.</p>

                <p class="about-one__text-2">Accountancy continues to be the most well-liked or in-demand program in
                    Australia. The Australian Trade Shortage List includes several accountancy jobs, indicating
                    continued growth for accounting experts. An accountancy certificate from an Australian university
                    can open up a vast range of employment choices in Australia if you are fascinated by accounting and
                    want to create a viable career in this industry. You may be able to obtain Australian permanent
                    residency (PR) through the accounting programs. An accounting specialist typically earns between
                    $70,000 and $80,000 per year. However, this price range will certainly rise in the coming time. </p>
                <h5 class="txt mt-4">Engineering</h5>
                <p class="about-one__text-2">As you are fully aware, engineering is the next item on our agenda. It’s a
                    profession that creates, designs, builds, uses, and maintains machines, processes, infrastructures,
                    and other objects that assist people in achieving practical objectives or resolving global issues.
                    Students who decide to gain knowledge in the field may have the opportunity to fill the nation’s
                    shortage of mechanical and industrial engineers and chemical, electrical, electronics, and
                    communications engineers.You should enroll in a chosen Engineering school if you enjoy challenges,
                    producing design, production, or innovation.</p>
                <h5 class="txt mt-4">Hotel Management</h5>
                <p class="about-one__text-2">Australia’s robust tourist sector provides trained and talented workers
                    with career opportunities.The demand for qualified professionals in hospitality management is
                    increasing along with the annual growth of the Australian tourism industry. As a result, numerous
                    restaurants, cafes, and hotels in Australia are operating with inadequate personnel levels.
                    Therefore, completing a tourism and hospitality management program will give you access to the
                    Australian tourism industry.</p>
                <p class="about-one__text-2">In Australia, a hospitality manager makes a mean annual pay of $73,712.So,
