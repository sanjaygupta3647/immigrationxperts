"Ashish Jain (Software Engineer)","1208","<p style=""text-align: justify;"">After lot of persuasion from my friends to apply for Australian immigration, I appeared for IETLS and successfully scored 7.5 (29<sup>th</sup> June), giving me 10 additional points.
I calculated my score, coming out to be 65 which would enable me to get Invite, but with a glitch…I passed out in Electronics and even if I had more than 10 years<div class=""target"" style=""display: none;""> of experience in SW, I was applying as Software Engineer &amp; risk was that ACS will cut few years.I didn’t want that to happen, as it would mean I will not get maximum marks for experience (8 years – 15 points) and my score could drop to 60 or worst case 55.So I decided to find a consultant as I didn’t wanted to take any chances ..Most of my friends who were gone through process were from Bangalore &amp; I needed to find a local consultant so I thought about visiting few before taking a decision.After searching on google and reading lot of reviews, I met <a href=""https://www.immigrationxperts.com/our-team/"">Mr. Manish Srivastava</a> in ImmigrationXperts.com on 11<sup>th</sup> July 2015. I find him a true professional &amp; and expert in his field, clarified all of my doubts and even offered to return 100% of the fees paid  in case I don’t’ qualify. I decided to sign contract immediately impressed by his honesty.
Rest is history …
Here are details (impressive by any standard):
-        11<sup>th</sup> July (First meeting)
-        29<sup>th</sup> July (ACS filed), I didn’t manage to get experience letter, so Manish helped me preparing Statutory declarations
-        2<sup>nd</sup> Aug (ACS cleared, full points J), Wow!  (My friend had warned me that it could take 3 months &amp; here I got it in 3 days!!!)
-        3<sup>rd</sup> Aug (EOI filed)
-        7<sup>th</sup> Sep (Invite received)
-        5<sup>th</sup> Oct (PCC done)
-        8<sup>th</sup> Oct (Fees submitted)
-        12<sup>th</sup> Oct (Medical done)
-        5<sup>th</sup> Nov (Visa received)
Whole process less than &lt; 4 months in 93 days !

"Blind Trust’ is the word which is synonymous with ImmigrationXperts.com","6392","<p style=""text-align: justify;"">All those who are dreaming to <a href=""https://www.immigrationxperts.com/australia-immigration-consultants/australia-skilled-migration/"">immigrate to Australia </a>but still are exceedingly  skeptical to choose a right consultant , then you must read my marvelous experience with <a href=""https://www.immigrationxperts.com/"">ImmigrationXperts</a>. I hope that my experience will definitely help you to choose the right path and warn you of the impostors in the market, who do nothing but make money.</p>
<div class=""target"">
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Initially, as everyone does, I began by doing a market survey to be sure that the consultant I choose should be genuine and honest in the work; which I think is of paramount importance. The reason being, I found that the market was inundated with fraud agencies and uneducated executives who were always on their toes to  trap the applicants.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><em>I visited many firms who claimed to have high success rate, boasted of having knowledgeable case officers and spoke about their meticulous work ethics. However, it was agonizing  to find that neither  their team knew much about the process nor did they had any transparency</em> .In addition to this, different consultants were of different views each time when asked with queries about the process. Moreover, the fees everyone quoted was extremely high. <strong>One of the firm, which has branches pan India, rejected my case for Australian Immigration</strong>. <em>The reason they cited - my work experience in Software Domain did not match with my education qualification which was in Electronics Stream</em> . I clearly remember that they told ACS would deny my case at the outset.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><em>It was then, I decided to give a last shot by visiting one more consultants ImmigrationXpert . In first meeting with <a href=""https://www.immigrationxperts.com/our-team/"">Manish Srivastava</a>, he explained the case with minute details and the ambiguities which others had created were removed in a jiffy. His success rate, transparency, confidence and adroitness in work pushed me to take the case ahead with his team. He was the only one(as my case was rejected by all ) who was dead sure that positive ACS would be received with 7 days . This was the statement which speaks volume about his experience and prowess in the domain.</em></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><em><strong>The result- I got the ACS within 7 days from filing; EOI - 1 month and VISA GRANT in 34 days. I am in touch with many other applicants who received the Invite to Apply in less than a month and VISA GRANT within 20 days; which is unthinkable and unprecedented. Moreover, these are not one-off cases but the percentage of such cases are high.</strong></em></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><em>From my experience , I can easily say that  Manish Srivastava and Team are the go-to consultants. Sheer transparency, low consultation fees and top-notch guidance are their USP which I did not find anywhere. ‘Blind Trust’ is the word which is synonymous with ImmigrationXpert- a word which one can never think considering the fact that there are many people to misguide you. Also, a big thanks to Chinki Gupta, for prompt and quick replies to all the queries and solutions provided.</em></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">ImmigrationXperts are the ones whom I will recommend to everyone looking for immigration.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">“I received the Australian visa grant today - Skilled - Independent (subclass 189). It is like a dream come true. After been deceived and dejected by many renowned visa consultants in Delhi, I was about to lose hope to <a href=""https://www.immigrationxperts.com/australia-immigration-consultants/"">migrate to Australia</a>. Luckily, I saw ImmigrationXperts while googling for other <a href=""https://www.immigrationxperts.com/australia-immigration-consultants/australia-skilled-migration/"">Australian PR consultants</a>. I thought to give a try.</p>
<div class=""target"">
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">My first meeting with Mr. Manish was very informative. I was highly impressed with the knowledge he has in this domain. He is a ‘Guru’. The best part is that he provided me an honest opinion (unlike other consultants whom I met earlier).My Previous consultant at Nehru place charged me Rs.1.25 lacs for Canada Express Entry at CRS 390, and my one year was wasted as draw were held at 450+ always, after being shattered and duped by previous consultant , thereafter I contacted ImmigrationXperts.com.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><em><strong>Had I not visited ImmigrationXperts and met <a href=""https://www.immigrationxperts.com/our-team/"">Mr. Manish Srivastava</a>, this would have not been possible.</strong></em>I was initially thinking to apply for State sponsorship visa as I was not much optimistic about qualifying for Independent visa based on my work experience. After reviewing my case Mr. Manish assured me that I should definitely go for the latter. Post my first meeting with him, I didn’t had an iota of doubt in my mind that my case was now in professional hands.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">My case was handled by Ms. Chinki Gupta. I would like to say ‘Big Thanks!!’ to her. Starting from day one of my visa processing until I got the same, she helped me a lot in preparing and validating the documents. I highly appreciate the efforts she had put in with high level of precision to ensure flawless paper work. Apart from this she answered all my queries through emails and calls with promptness and patience.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><em><strong>The time frame in which my application got processed was even a surprise for me. My ACS was cleared <span data-term=""goog_740645983"">in 10 days</span> (without any major cut in experience). ITA was received <span data-term=""goog_740645984"">in 41 days</span>. I received visa <span data-term=""goog_740645985"">within 21 days</span> after filing, which was icing on the cake. The entire process took around 4 months.</strong></em></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">If your dream is to migrate to Australia then Mr. Manish and ImmigrationXpert team are the guys who will make it come true. They are the best Australian Immigration Consultants &amp; wonderful team of professionals. I recommend ImmigrationXpert to all the aspirants, especially those who think that their case is complicated.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">I wish ImmigrationXperts very best for the future. With the dedication, honesty and hard work which they exhibit, undoubtedly their success with touch new horizon!</p>

Thanks for your dedicated efforts. Please find below my testimonial -</p>
<p>
During my initial search for hiring an immigration consultant services for Canadian PR application, I contacted nearly 10 - 12 immigration services. When I first communicated with <a href=""https://www.immigrationxperts.com/our-team/""><b><u>Mr. Manish Srivastava </u></b>(Principal Consultant)</a>, I got the feeling that most probably this is the consulting service that I was desperately looking for. The following clarifications were clearly stated during my first interaction with Mr. Manish -</p>
<div class=""target"">
<ol>
	<li>The fee structure was clearly intimated (there were no hidden charges !!). The worded payment terms and conditions were quite consumer friendly (in comparison to other immigration services).</li>
	<li>The RCIC related information was clearly provided.</li>
	<li>Based on my inputs, I was <b>honestly </b>suggested that what are the best options available for me.</li>
</ol>

<p>I formally started my application journey in May 2015 and was finally awarded the PR visa in October 2016. During this whole journey, <a href=""https://www.immigrationxperts.com/our-team/"">Mr. Kamal Channi (RCIC Lawyer)</a>, Mr. Manish and Ms. Chinki Gupta (Case Processing Manager) were quite approachable and used to patiently answer all the queries.</p>

<p>The primary benefits that I realized during my stint with ImmigrationXperts team are -</p>
<ol>
	<li>They are actually (this is the keyword !!) knowledgeable and have clear cut understanding of the end to end Canada Visa application process.</li>

"The team at Immigrationxperts acted as a great catalyst in our process towards receiving the Australian PR","6766","<p style=""text-align: justify;"">When we decided to apply for <a href=""https://www.immigrationxperts.com/australia-immigration-consultants/australia-skilled-migration/"">Australia’s PR visa</a>, we started looking for forums online for help and guidance from our friends already in Australia. Within a week, we realised that this was a tough task and although we had the dedication but the commitment and time was something we were lacking in.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">My husband decided that we should go through the proper means and look for an agent to help us out. Even though I was skeptical about this decision initially but if you ask me today I think that was the best decision ever made and the cherry on the cake was that we found <a href=""http://immigrationxperts.com/"" data-saferedirecturl=""https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=http://immigrationxperts.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1487742385112000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHltANjqODP_r_b3D-r5xP28soQDg"">immigrationxperts.com</a>. Immigration Xperts offers great service. We have just visited their office once and since then all our communication has been via phone and emails. <strong>Not once did we feel the need to visit their office again.</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The team at immigrationxperts.com is efficient and always ready to help. <em><strong>If for some reason, they are not able to take your call, you can </strong></em>be rest<em><strong> assured that you will get a call-in return at the earliest possible. No matter how many times you bother them with the same kind of questions, they never lose their cool and make sure that all our doubts are cleared.</strong></em></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">I would like to thank <strong>Chinki Gupta</strong>, who guided us throughout our process and not once we felt that she did not give her best to the job always. There were times when we were not sure about certain documents and we would call her for advice and she would willingly explain the whole process to us and always guide us towards the best solution.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>I would like to congratulate <a href=""https://www.immigrationxperts.com/our-team/"">Manish Srivastava</a> on forming such an active and talented team</strong>.<strong><em> I would also like to add that even though we spoke to Manish directly very few times, but he was always updated about the details of our case.</em></strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Some points that I would like to highlight about Immigration Experts:</p>

<ol style=""text-align: justify;"">
 	<li>Quick responses to all kind of queries</li>
 	<li>Up to date about all the processes involved in getting visa.</li>
 	<li>Correct advice and guidance throughout the whole process</li>
 	<li>They are stickler for details which is beneficial for us as we know that if we end up making mistake they will cover it up for us.</li>
</ol>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The team at Immigrationxperts acted as a great catalyst in our process towards receiving the Australian PR. I am glad that we chose <a href=""http://immigrationxperts.com/"" data-saferedirecturl=""https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=http://immigrationxperts.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1487742385112000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHltANjqODP_r_b3D-r5xP28soQDg"">immigrationxperts.com</a>.
