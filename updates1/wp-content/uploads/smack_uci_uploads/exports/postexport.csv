"ACS Issues Skill Assessment Guidelines for Applicants for ICT Occupations","486","		<p>The Australian Computer Society is an authenticated assessing authority for ICT occupations. It lays down some instructions for state nomination applications for ICT occupations.</p>
<p><strong>ICT occupations- offshore applicants</strong></p>
<p>July 4<sup>th</sup> 2016 onwards the offshore applicants for ICT occupations that appear on the state nominated occupation list for immigration SA would require achieving a higher point constraint on the department of immigration and border protection (DIBP) points test. This rule is applicable on the occupations including a skills assessment from ACS.</p>
<p>To know more about the current minimum point requirement for your ICT occupation, please refer to the <a href=""http://www.migration.sa.gov.au/skilled-migrants/about-the-lists-of-state-nominated-occupations"">state nominated occupation list</a>. To your concern, immigration SA will provide a notice of seven calendar days instructing of any changes to the points required. Keep yourself posted by subscribing to the <a href=""http://www.migration.sa.gov.au/skilled-migrants/lists-of-state-nominated-occupations"">occupation list</a> on the Immigration SA website.</p>
<p>Any occupation that has met its planning level will be considered listed as “special conditions” and the applicants will only be eligible if they fall under one of the special conditions categories. A minimum of 60 points is needed in this case.</p>
<p><strong>ICT occupations- working in South Australia/ South Australian graduate </strong></p>
<p>The higher point constraint mentioned above will not be applicable in some cases like:</p>
<ol>
<li>If you are currently working in a skilled occupation in South Australia.</li>
<li>If you are applying under the international graduate of south Australian category.</li>
</ol>
<p>For the aforementioned cases, a minimum of 60 points only is needed (comprising state nomination points)</p>
<p><strong>ICT occupations &ndash; work experience points</strong></p>
<p>The ACS skills assessment will declare the date from which your skilled work experience is recognized from. For example:</p>
<p>The following employment after February 2014 is considered to equate to work at an appropriately skilled level and relevant to 261111 (ICT business analyst) of the  code.</p>
<p>So, before you claim work experience points for your SkillSelect Expression of Interest (EOI), ensure to check the date as mentioned above in the example. <strong>Any points claimed prior to this date will not be accepted and your state nomination application will be refused due to points being wrongly claimed.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Additional Documents Required</strong></p>
<p>If you are claiming points, then you also need to provide additional evidence while applying for an ICT occupation with higher point requirement.</p>
<p>There would be a supplementary page given at the end of the state nomination application where you can upload additional documents required.</p>
<p>Also, there is a work experience page where you can upload your work experience reference.</p>
<p>Below mentioned are the additional documents required, if you are claiming points in your SkillSelect expression of Interest (EOI). To know more, click visit the <a href=""http://www.migration.sa.gov.au/upload/publications/Skilled-Migrants/GSM-Skilled-Nomination-document-checklist.pdf"">document checklist.</a></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Qualification:</strong> This document is needed only if this is to obtain points for a qualification that is not listed in ACS skills assessment. It would include graduation certificate/ an academic transcript/ letter of completion from the institution.</li>
<li><strong>Work experience:</strong> This document is required only to obtain additional work experience points for the work experience not listed in the ACS assessment. It would include letter from current and previous employers confirming commencement date, duties and tasks, job title, salary and number of working hours per week.</li>
<li><strong>Community language</strong>: A copy of the National Accreditation Authority for translators and interpreters (NAATI) authorization.</li>
<li><strong>Partner skills points</strong>: A copy of the authenticate skills assessment for the main applicant’s partner.</li>

"Australia needs a quick-fix to arrange for extra 100,000 ICT pros required by 2020!","491","		<p align=""justify"" class=""western""><span style=""font-family: Bell MT,serif;""><span style=""font-size: medium;"">It is no news to anyone today that the ICT industry is booming unimaginably and at a much higher rate than was predicted by the experts in the beginning of the new millennium. Australia is no exception, where the government sector equally employees as much of ICT graduates as does the private sector. A recent study suggests that the department of immigration (DIBP) of Australia employees as many as 1600 ICT professionals, the highest by a single concern in the country.</span></span></p>
<p align=""justify"" class=""western""><span style=""font-family: Bell MT,serif;""><span style=""font-size: medium;"">The same study, an outcome of a prolonged and deep research conducted jointly by the Australian Computer Society (ACS) and Deloitte Access Economics, was released on July 8</span></span><sup><span style=""font-family: Bell MT,serif;""><span style=""font-size: medium;"">th</span></span></sup><span style=""font-family: Bell MT,serif;""><span style=""font-size: medium;"">., 2015, and it throws light upon certain very important aspects of the ICT industry of Australia. It reveals that presently about 600,000 professionals are engaged with the ICT industry in the country and the requirement will go up by another 100,000 till 2020. While that is great news for the country’s IT sector, the problem lies elsewhere, which has been pointed out very critically in the report.</span></span></p>
<p align=""justify"" class=""western""><span style=""font-family: Bell MT,serif;""><span style=""font-size: medium;"">It finds out that while the number of engineering graduates and post graduates enrolling in the Australian universities annually since 2000 has grown by about 35% and 12% respectively, the undergraduates pursuing ICT has gone down substantially by about 30%. There is also a decrease of about 10% in ICT post graduate enrolments. Compare this to the need for ICT pros in Victoria alone that is projected to go up by 40,000, almost 3.2% annually over the next six years! The question that this study obviates is thus wherefrom will this extra band of people flow in?</span></span></p>
<p align=""justify"" class=""western""><span style=""font-family: Bell MT,serif;""><span style=""font-size: medium;"">If Australia loses self-sustainability in ICT, they have to fill it up through immigrant experts! As the major share of domestic experts are engulfed by the government jobs, the pressure automatically falls upon the private sector to arrange for the overseas workforce! This is an additional burden to the private companies. Why? Well, let’s check that out!</span></span></p>
<p align=""justify"" class=""western""><span style=""font-family: Bell MT,serif;""><span style=""font-size: medium;"">Bringing in overseas workforce through 457 type of visa is apparently easy since a lot of skilled experts are available in India, China and a few other countries. But the process of immigration is a long drawn one and a company trying to hire overseas pros has to bear most of the cost. There is however no guarantee that the worker joining in will not leave before this expenditure is equalled out! There is no chance of any kind of bonded service in Australia!</span></span></p>
<p align=""justify"" class=""western""><span style=""font-family: Bell MT,serif;""><span style=""font-size: medium;"">Secondly, the overseas workers have to be offered more amenities, perks and salaries than domestic ones! This also results in the overhead cost of the companies shooting up! Infusing too many of overseas employees can thus eat into the profit margin of the companies.</span></span></p>
<p align=""justify"" class=""western""><span style=""font-family: Bell MT,serif;""><span style=""font-size: medium;"">The solution as suggested by this report lies elsewhere. One suggestion is to completely odify the school curricula to make the kids oriented towards digital learning, innovation and orientation. Governmental policies and business practices existing have been identified as insufficient in this respect, and need a revamp!</span></span></p>
<p align=""justify"" class=""western""><span style=""font-family: Bell MT,serif;""><span style=""font-size: medium;"">However, an interesting thing also revealed in it says that almost 43% of ICT pros presently did not have an academic background of engineering or computers. That is perhaps the only immediate ray of hope for ICT companies in Australia!</span></span></p>

"Easy Processing of Australia Visa Can Happen Through an Able Consultant","495","
		<p align=""justify"" class=""western""><span style=""font-family: Bell MT,serif;""><span style=""font-size: medium;"">Going abroad to settle down permanently can be a complicated process since a lot of documentation is required. While working, it is difficult to prepare all of them on time and with perfection. The punctuality also matters a lot since many a time a time deadline has to be met. It is thus better to go for visa consultants who are aware of the specific requirements for different countries.</span></span></p>
<p align=""justify"" class=""western""><span style=""font-family: Bell MT,serif;""><span style=""font-size: medium;""><b>Visa requirements for Australia</b></span></span></p>
<p align=""justify"" class=""western""><span style=""font-family: Bell MT,serif;""><span style=""font-size: medium;"">Different countries demand different kind of papers for granting a visa. For Australia, the processes are a bit simpler. There have been many from the subcontinent, especially India, going to Australia over the last few decades with the number increasing gradually over time. The present Australian regime has been liberal enough extend the invitation to more and more of aspiring migrants.</span></span></p>
<p align=""justify"" class=""western""><span style=""font-family: Bell MT,serif;""><span style=""font-size: medium;"">If one wants to process a visa to the land of the kangaroos without a hitch, it is smart to contact the </span></span><a href=""https://www.immigrationxperts.com/immigration-consultants-pune""><span style=""font-family: Bell MT,serif;""><span style=""font-size: medium;"">Australian immigration consultants in Pune</span></span></a><span style=""font-family: Bell MT,serif;""><span style=""font-size: medium;"">. There are many types of visas available for Australia, like family visa, study visa, skilled worker visa, business visa and travel visa. Each is different from the other and has different requirements of paperworks. Only a consultant can come in handy with the required expertise in processing each of them for separate applicants.</span></span></p>
<p align=""justify"" class=""western""><span style=""font-family: Bell MT,serif;""><span style=""font-size: medium;""><b>Platform for connecting to best visa consultants</b></span></span></p>
<p align=""justify"" class=""western""><span style=""font-family: Bell MT,serif;""><span style=""font-size: medium;"">Many of the websites offer themselves as platforms for connecting to various visa consultants in the country. They provide the authentic contact information for Australia visa consultants in Noida, Pune and Mumbai, so that one can drop a query and get the fastest response. In order to get a </span></span><a href=""https://www.immigrationxperts.com/australia/australia-travel-visa/visitor-visa""><span style=""font-family: Bell MT,serif;""><span style=""font-size: medium;"">visitor visa to Australia</span></span></a><span style=""font-family: Bell MT,serif;""><span style=""font-size: medium;"">, all one has to do is connect to one of these consultants.</span></span></p>
<p align=""justify"" class=""western""><span style=""font-family: Bell MT,serif;""><span style=""font-size: medium;"">However, one also must be a bit cautious, since these websites have no role in pricing and legalities. They act only as facilitators and the final bargaining has to be done with the consultants directly. If anything goes wrong in visa processing, the consultants are only responsible and not the websites who are just mediators. It is thus better to know the extent of the roles these websites can play before using them.</span></span></p>

"Interesting to watch the trend- Indians fastest growing migrant population to Australia","497","<p class=""western"" align=""justify""><span style=""font-family: Bell MT,serif;""><span style=""font-size: medium;"">Among the many countries to have opened the floodgate for world population to enter them, Australia is on the top. Like many other developed countries of the world, they have also realized that the future in development lies in soft skills that will drive the IT industry, which eventually will determine among the countries being developed and developing.</span></span></p>
<p class=""western"" align=""justify""><span style=""font-family: Bell MT,serif;""><span style=""font-size: medium;"">Hence, the Australian authorities have made the visa rules to the country extremely simple than the earlier days. While the documents required have lessened down resulting in an ease of application, the number of consulates have also increased worldwide. Most importantly, the applications can now be submitted online with the help of approved agents who can clarify the rules and guidelines. Even e-visa and visa on arrival facilities have been extended to many nations wherefrom skilled and knowledgeable population is preferred.</span></span></p>
<p class=""western"" align=""justify""><span style=""font-family: Bell MT,serif;""><span style=""font-size: medium;""><b>Upsurge in migrants over the last decade</b></span></span></p>
<p class=""western"" align=""justify""><span style=""font-family: Bell MT,serif;""><span style=""font-size: medium;"">All these have led to an upsurge in the number of migrants from various countries to Australia over the last decade and especially since 2010. It is really interesting to take a note of the pattern of migration to Australia.</span></span></p>
<p class=""western"" align=""justify""><span style=""font-family: Bell MT,serif;""><span style=""font-size: medium;"">Being an English speaking nation, people from the United Kingdom were preferred as migrants since the beginning of legal immigration to Australia. But later on, English speaking nations like India have caught up. In fact, there are more numbers of skilled and qualified professionals in India due to an increase in higher education opportunities therein, but lesser number of jobs. Hence, the educated population there was looking for green pastures overseas, and Australia provided them one!</span></span></p>
<p class=""western"" align=""justify""><span style=""font-family: Bell MT,serif;""><span style=""font-size: medium;"">The latest government figures reveal evidences of the fact that Indians have surpassed all and are now the topmost country from where migrants are coming in to Australia. In 2013-’14, data from the Department of Immigration of the Govt. of Australia shows that Indian migrants were numbered at close to 40,000, followed by New Zealand and China, and the UK at no. 4. While China clocked at 26,776, the UK had 23,220 migrants.While New Zealand, Pakistan and the Philippines followed in closely, India, China and the UK made up for 46.9% of the total population of legal migrants to Australia in the last year.</span></span></p>
<p class=""western"" align=""justify""><span style=""font-family: Bell MT,serif;""><span style=""font-size: medium;"">An interesting analysis reveals an even more unbelievable truth- the number of Chinese migrants has trebled over the last 17 years to Australia at 427,590, but that from India has quadrupled over the same period to 369,680! From the UK, the population has grown by just a mere 5% over the same duration.</span></span></p>
<p class=""western"" align=""justify""><span style=""font-family: Bell MT,serif;""><span style=""font-size: medium;""><b>India right on top Down Under!</b></span></span></p>
<p class=""western"" align=""justify""><span style=""font-family: Bell MT,serif;""><span style=""font-size: medium;"">Figures clearly prove the increasing rate of Indian migrants to Australia, driven by various factors. Some of the reasons are availability of qualified professionals in India, lack of job opportunities back home, English speaking capability and ease of adaptation in a new country! Interestingly enough, studies also reveal that the highest numbers of migrants coming in with work travel visa and then going missing and not returning also is topped by China and India very closely, as shown by sc457 visa records analysed by the Fair Work Ombudsman in Australia. It clearly seems that this trend is going to continue for at least a decade more before global powers and trends take a major shift once again!</span></span></p>",,"2016-06-10 11:23:20","interesting-to-watch-the-trend-indians-fastest-growing-migrant-population-to-australia","1","publish","https://www.immigrationxperts.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/blog-2.jpg",,,"1","open","0","off","off","30","#000","0","off","0","96",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Blog|Australia",

"Fair Work Commission increases the minimum wage level with an addition of $15.80 a week","613","		<p>The lowest paid workers in Australia will earn an extra amount of $15.80 a week as per the annual minimum wage decision was taken by the Fair Work Commission.</p>
<p>Justice Iain Ross, the president of Fair Work Commission conveyed the conclusion that the lowest paid workers of the nation will now get an increase in wage payment by 2.4%.</p>
<p>An increase in 2.4% of wage payment shall mean the workers will now earn $672.70 every week. If converted into the hourly basis, a worker earns $17.70 per hour. The commission mentioned that this wage decision will affect over 1.86 million workers of Australia.</p>
<p>The minimum wage was increased by 2.5% in the previous year which amounted to $656.90 every week or calculated as $17.29 per hour.</p>
<p>The change in the minimum wage will come into effect from July 1, 2016.</p>
<p>ACTU expected at least $30 per week for the workers. This increase in wages amounts to half of the amount expected by ACTU.</p>
<p>This rise in wages is anyhow more than what the business groups had argued for. They expected a rise of wages from $7.90 to $10.50.</p>
<p>The retailers believe that they will have to cut down the working hours of the workers or else will have to put a ‘stop’ in entertaining new staff due to the increase in the minimum wages policy. Mr. Russell Zimmerman, from the Australian Retailers Association, mentioned that the rise in wages was more than the expected rates and it was impossible for them to afford the price rise. He further added that this would be unfortunately a big problem for the industry. According to him, he agrees to the retailers as they will have to look at their payrolls and will have to decide if working hours of the workers have to be reduced.</p>
<p>He said that the industry was seen to have a growth of 3.6% annually with some of the state's growing only 0.9%. To this statement, according to his opinion, what this price rise would do is that it would make sure that no more people are employed at the moment and it would be a sad state of the affairs for the industry. He explained giving an example that if an industry is assumed with a large workforce, say of 1000 people, then an increase in the wages of approximately $17.70 every week would turn to be a big slug on the wage bill. If looked towards an industry which has been struggling to maintain its numbers, it would not really give a good outcome.</p>
<p>Mr. Ross believed that increasing the minimum wage would bring betterment to the standard of living or the poor workers in the nation. To this, he said that the households who relied on the low paid wages, their incomes were the reason that brought them to low poverty line.</p>
<p>According to him, it was the ‘modest improvement’ that would certainly not accelerate inflationary pressure. This increasing grade would not give any negative impact on the employment as well as on the inflationary pressure. Instead, the prevailing economic circumstances shall provide an opportunity to improve the relative living standards of the low-paid.</p>
<p>Both the major parties in the Federal Election Campaign focused on the conditions of the lowest paid workers of the nation. Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has been campaigning for the promotion of his innovation agenda and medical research in Sydney. The Opposition leader, Bill Shorten shall reveal the Labour’s plan to modify $1 billion of funding allocated for the infrastructure of Northern Australia to a particular fun for tourism like the airports or the convention centers.</p>
<p>The Fair Work Commission has also made changes in the penalty rates any decision relating to this would not be announced before the election on 2nd July. Mr. Turnbull stated that the Coalition had no preparations to change the penalty rates. Hence, the Labor leader was put in a ‘chaotic’ point on the subject of penalty rates.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr. Turnbull mentioned that they do not have any plans to change penalty rates as whatever it is; everything is a matter for Fair Work.</p>

"Australia’s Migration Programme Revamped","819","<p style=""text-align: justify;"">If we take a look at the numbers, next year’s programme planning level comprises of:</p>
&nbsp;
<ul>
<li style=""text-align: justify;""> 128500 places are reserved <strong>for skilled migrants</strong>, which include business migrants, general skilled and employer sponsored.</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;""> 60 885 places are for family migrants sponsored by family members in Australia residents who have retained close business, or have personal ties with Australia.</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;""> 565 places are for special eligibility migrants, which include former permanent residents who have cultural and personal ties with Australia.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The migration programme as usual is set by the Government annually and lists down the planning levels for <strong>permanent immigration to Australia</strong>. The migration programme aids Australia economically, through addressing instant and long-term skill shortages in the Australian workforce. It is a common problem as Australia faces skilled labor shortages and <em><strong>encourages immigration of skilled migrants</strong></em>.<br>
&nbsp;
The size and composition of the whole programme is set after extensive long stakeholder consultation around Australia, and takes into account other factors such as net overseas migration, demographic, economic and labor market trends.</p>
&nbsp;

<h2>What has changed from before?</h2>
&nbsp;

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The overall size of the programme is still the same as it was before, but there have been some changes that have been made:</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Some places have been moved into the employer sponsor category, which is intended to meet the instant to medium term skill shortages that remain in some industries in Australia. Employer sponsor category is a the best way to fill these skilled worker shortages. If the shortage is not met immediately, it will result in reduction of economic growth and productivity, which will affect the economy of the country. The skilled independent category has been reduced as people of Australia are worried that the direct competition with Australians in jobs will result in Australians having no jobs.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><em><strong>The Immigration trend</strong></em> has changed a lot and skilled migrants coming thorugh employer sponsor category have got a relaxation.</p>

<p>Then you just pay attention towards the new immigration policy that is going to be launched in Canada.</p>
<p>This is really nice to notice that very soon the Government of Canada is going to launch a new immigration policy. There will be application of points system which will select the worker from abroad, who can enter smoothly into the country. The Government of Canada states that this immigration policy will be in demand policy.</p>
<p>This particular immigration policy will mainly implemented for smooth entrance of foreign skilled workers for the vacant job especially where Canadian workers are not available. As per this policy the foreign workers at first must do their registration in the Government job bank.</p>
<p>This is an online registration and every skilled foreign worker must do it first. The candidates who are having most points will be eligible to settle permanently in Canada.<br>
For choosing the right candidate the Government will allot 600 points to each candidate and the highest point scorer will receive a permanent offer for the job. Here we can pay attention towards the statement given by the immigration Minister Chris Alexander. As per the policy, the immigrants who are considered as skilled for the job will be eligible to receive 1,200 points under <strong>Comprehensive Ranking System.</strong></p>
<p>Again these points will be provided to the immigrants on the basis of the following factors.</p>
<p>• Immigrants will be allowed a maximum of 500 points. This is called as per the Government the core human capital factors. This includes age of the immigrants, his or her education level, and proficiency in different language. The Government will also look after the matter of work experience of the immigrants in Canada.</p>
<p>• An immigrant will be eligible to receive maximum 100 points according to the factors related to skill transferability. This will include the education level of each immigrant and whether he or she possessed any work experience in abroad or not.</p>
<p>• Next we should pay attention over the allocation of points over the age. A maximum of 110 will be allotted to the immigrants who are within 20 to 29. If any immigrant is below 17 years of age or above 45 years of age will obtain zero point.<br>
The government of Canada has given statement in a press conference regarding the immigrants who will get permanent residency in Canada. As per this statement we can notice that the Government will offer permanent residency to approximately 65,000 to 75,000 skilled workers both from Canada and abroad. They will be eligible to get stable residency in 2015 as per the following categories:</p>
<p>• The government is looking to have at least 47,000 to 51,000 skilled workers coming from the combination of federal skilled workers and federal skilled trades.</p>
<p>• Again the Government is planning to have at least 21,000 to 23,000 skilled workers who must be from the experience working group in Canada.</p>
<p>Also, the Government has the plan to employ additional 46,000 to 48,000 skilled workers. All these employees will receive permanent residency in Canada. With the help of the provincial nominee program this permanent residencies will be provided to all the immigrants.</p>

"Australia May Ease Immigration Rules for Chinese Millionaires","825","		<p>It has recently come into notice that Australia may be thinking to ease rules on a <em><strong>visa scheme</strong></em> directly targeting investment from Chinese Millionaires to help clear a backlog of applications. There is a significantly old Investor Visa Scheme, which offers residency to overseas individuals who invest more that A$5 million in Australia. Moreover, under this programme the government anticipates that it will in due course&nbsp; raise A$6 billion a year. What is surprising is that under this programme more than 90 percent of the applicants are from China. The Australian Government is eyeing Chinese big shots and therefore, easing out the <em><strong>Australia immigration process for applicants</strong></em>. This will enable the country to raise a lot of revenue and it will boost the economy, but the question that strikes my mind is why there is an urgent need of overseas revenue and that too from China.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>High net-worth individuals in China are very private in relation to their total wealth, they will not invest in the programme until unless they are absolutely sure that they will get handsome returns. And this is exactly the problem that the Australian government is facing, the Chinese people have a lot of concerns about providing information about their financial status to the government, they suspect that the Australian government is leaking that information to the Chinese government. As evident, this is creating havoc in the <strong>immigration process</strong>, approval’s for visas are progressing at a snail’s pace, at least 20 percent of the applicants have either withdrawn or rejected, reason being want of more disclosures on the source of funding which the Australian government is not providing, there is no transparency.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Australia has declared it wants to speed up approvals and lawyers and agents expect to shed light on rules of source of funding by specifying time frame and proof to verify the money is clean. The new rules will probably be declared by November this year.</p>

"AUSTRALIA: The Most Liveable City in the World: Melbourne","842","<p>Its is not surprising that Victoria, and in particular, Melbourne continue to be in high demand for overseas migrants. In August 2013, the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) released their updated Global Liveability Survey which named, for the third consecutive year, Melbourne as the best city in the world to live.</p>
<p>Melbourne was followed in the ranking by Vienna, Vancouver and Toronto while the top 10 also featured other Australian cities, Adelaide, Sydney and Perth at number 6, 7 and 9 respectively. The EIU ranking’s top spots are occupied by mid-sized cities in wealthier countries with a relatively low population density. This means low crime rates, good infrastructure, health services and education opportunities as well as high availability of cultural and recreational activities.</p>
<p>Melbourne is a multicultural city with a vibrant arts scene complemented by its renowned café and culinary culture. Having been selected the world’s most liveable city for the third year in a row, Melbourne continues to attract large scale migration with a significant percentage of permanent migrants to Australia choosing to make Victoria home. According to figures provided the Department of Immigration and Citizenship (DIAC), more than 300,000 new migrants have settled in Victoria in the last 5 years.&gt;</p>

"Skilled Migration Forum in Perth Is Greeted With Union Protest","848","		<p>More than 250 unionists blocked the entrance of a Perth hotel where the conference on foreign workers was going on. The Duxton hotel in Perth witnessed a ravaging protest by angry unionists against the Federal Government’s decision to reverse the previous Labor Government’s restrictions on the occupation of foreign workers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Senator addressed the annual Australian Mines and Metals Association (AMMA) <em><strong>skilled migration</strong></em> conference. The Labor’s Federal immigration and Border Protection spokesman was also present at the annual event.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The street outside the hotel was filled with groups of Banner-waving protestors blocking the entrance.</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The reason behind this fuss is that the Unionists are angry about the Government’s decision to ease rules revolving around foreign employment on the offshore oil and gas projects.</p>
<p>The Federal court ordered Maritime Union of Australia (<strong>MUA</strong>) to measures introduced by the Abbott Government, which pursued to abolish restrictions lying on the employment of non- Australian workers on the sites.</p>
<p>This came as a shock as the former government has amended the Migration Act to expand the migration norms as a result of which foreign workers needed a <strong>permanent visa</strong> to work on offshore oil and gas platforms.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, this year, the Abbott Government introduced a new regulation that would allow temporary visas to be acceptable for non-Australian workers and null and void the need for these workers to obtain a permanent visa to work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is good news for the foreign workers as the previous act is not in power now, the amendment allows foreign workers to work without a permanent visa.

"Guilty Immigration Officer Flees Australia with 1.2 Million in the Bank","852","<p>Recently, a corrupt immigration official and her husband who were allegedly involved in a $3 million visa racket were allowed to flee the country with more than a million in the bank soon after their home was stormed by federal agents.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reetika Ajjan, who was a former employee of the <strong>Australian Department of Immigration</strong>, was accused of supplying government information and equipment to an illegal racket whose master mind was her husband Jeetender, which caused in more than 1,000 deceitful visa applications. This is shocking <strong>news for Australia’s Immigration</strong> Department who had no clue that this racket has been operational for many years.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A police raid at the couple’s house turned up almost $500,000 in cash, which was enough to charge the couple with the felony.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But unfortunately, Mr. and Ms. Ajjan were successful in fleeing the country because the Immigration Department was unsuccessful to seize passports or safeguard a criminal charge was laid quickly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Surprisingly, the couples were also able to wire $1.2 million to India safely in the days after the raid and before they fled to India. This has resulted in a buzz in the <strong>immigration scenario</strong> all over the world. The Australian Government is dazed at their incompetence to catch the couple and not having knowledge of this shocking event.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A press conference from the Immigration Department, conveyed that investigators thought Ms. Ajjan should be heavily charged for dealing with proceeds of crime of a value exceeding $100,000, which carries a penalty of up to 20 years in jail for engaging in this felony with her partner.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ms. Ajjan and her accused husband are now happily living in <strong>Delhi </strong>and <strong>Australian</strong> authorities are unable to press charges against them, their best hope is to at least attempt to recover the $1.2 million she transferred to India, which is alleged to be the proceeds of crime, but the Australian Federal Police has indicated the money may be difficult to recover. These shocking events take place many a times in different countries; the authorities need to be more alert so that these rackets don’t take place</p>

<p>“We have seen press reports on briefings by Australian Minister of Immigration and Border Protection Scott Morrison on the issue of 157 persons who are held up at sea off the shores of Australia and his interactions with Home Minister and External Affairs Minister in New Delhi on July 23.</p>
<p>“India has a policy of not supporting illegal migration either into India or anywhere outside India. During the visit of Minister Morrison to India, the Indian authorities have clearly conveyed to the Australian side that the first requirement is to provide consular access to Indian High Commission officials in Australia to the persons,” a Home Ministry statement said.</p>
<p>It further said India’s policy is to accept return of Indian citizens and other persons whose return it is obligated to accept under applicable Indian domestic law.</p>
<p>“As per current policy, India will take back its own nationals provided the consular access clearly determines their origin,” it said.</p>
<p>During the meeting with Morrison, Singh and Swaraj had asked him to provide consular access to 157 people whose boat was seized by Australia and asked him to ensure that no harm is caused to any of the detainees.</p>
<p>A group of 157 asylum seekers, including Sri Lankan Tamils, were held at sea for weeks by Australia. The group, including women and children were now being transferred to the Cocos Islands, and then would be flown to Curtin detention centre in remote Western Australia, media reports said.</p>

"Australian visa centre opens in Jalandhar","861","<p>The Australian Government has moved to meet a growing demand in Punjab for visas to Australia by opening a brand new Visa Application Centre (VAC) in Jalandhar, operated by its commercial partner, VFS Global.</p>
<p>Jose Alvarez, the Australian Government’s Minister Counselor for Immigration and Regional Director (South Asia) inaugurated the centre on July 3.</p>
<p>Australia’s High Commissioner to India, Patrick Suckling, welcomed the new facility and said that the centre would make it much more convenient for people in the region to apply for visas to Australia. He said “The flow of people between India and Australia is increasing in volume, and this is deepening and strengthening the bonds between our two countries,”</p>
<p>“I am confident Australia would continue to receive increased number of business visitors, tourists, skilled migrants and students from India, which will continue to benefit our bilateral relationship,” he added. Vishal Jairath, Regional Head- South Asia, VFS Global, was also present and said“VFS Global is privileged to partner with the Government of Australia to open a new Visa Application Centre in Jalandhar. This will enhance the visa application experience of travellers to Australia from Punjab.” He said that VFS Global has been associated with the Government of Australia in India since 2007, and this extension would go a long way in forging a longstanding partnership. It is pertinent to mention here that for the</p>
<p>first time in its history, the Australian High Commission in New Delhi issued more than 100,000 tourism visas to Indians in a single financial year (1 July 2013 to 30 June 2014), with numbers increasing by 10 percent in the first three months this year.</p>

"Australia Issues Validity Period for Skills Assessment","865","		<p>Just after the immigration changes were declared by the <em>Australian Department of Immigration and Border Protection</em> <strong>(DIBP)</strong>, a three year validity period will be functional for skills assessment issued by assessing authorities for the purpose of visa applications which will be applicable from July 1, 2014.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is great news as several skill assessments did not have validity periods in the past. This will help encourage immigration from all over the world for people who are looking to <em><strong>migrate to Australia</strong></em>. The DIBP officer conveyed that the default three year validity period for skills assessment is to balance out the existing three year validity period for English Language Tests. Earlier only English language test had <em>three years validity period</em>, realizing that at least the same amount of time is required for other skills assessment the DIBP came to the conclusion of increasing validity period for all skills assessments.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Consequently, a skills assessment preparation to apply for an <em><strong>Australian visa</strong></em> need be valid at the time of visa lodgment from the 1st of July for various visas comprising:</p>
<p>Direct Entry stream of the Employer Nominated Scheme (subclass 186) visa, in which you are entitled for a visa if an employer who is a permanent residence of Australia offers you a job and sponsors you. Benefit of which is that it is easy to get a visa, there are minimal paperwork and regulations</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Direct Entry stream of the Regional Sponsored Migration Scheme (subclass 187) visa</p>
<p>Graduate Work stream of the Temporary Graduate (subclass 485) visa</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In accordance, a skills assessment is required to be valid at the time of invitation to apply through Skill Select for the visas including:</p>

"Australia: Sydney migration agent jailed for fraud","877","<p>Wednesday, 23 April 2014</p>
<p>The Federal Government said that the jailing of a former migration agent for immigration fraud sent a strong message to the industry that fraudulent and illegal behaviour will not be tolerated.</p>
<p>Ms Xiao Ying Wu (known as Amy Wu), was based in Sydney’s Chinatown and pleaded guilty to forging immigration documents and defrauding her clients, who were seeking assistance with visa applications, in order to obtain more than $80 000.</p>
<p>She was sentenced today in the Downing Centre District Court to 21 months’ imprisonment, with five months to be served, in relation to two Commonwealth charges of using false documents to obtain benefits.</p>
<p>She also received 18 months’ imprisonment with five months’ minimum term (to be served concurrently) for two charges under the NSW Crimes Act of dishonestly obtaining a financial advantage.</p>
<p>The court also made a reparation order in relation to the Commonwealth charges of $13 405 and $18 935 to the respective victims and a compensation order relating to the state charges of $31 550 and $10 000 for her victims.</p>
<p>Assistant Minister for Immigration and Border Protection, Senator the Hon Michaelia Cash, said an investigation into Wu’s activities began in response to a referral from the Office of the Migration Agents Registration Authority, as well as complaints received directly from the community.</p>
<p>Minister Cash said the case served as a warning to would-be fraudsters that the government will actively pursue the prosecution of people involved in immigration fraud and unlawfully obtaining Australian visas.</p>
<p>‘The government takes allegations of fraud by those in trusted positions, such as registered migration agents, very seriously,’ Minister Cash said.</p>

<div class=""col-md-9"">
<p>Paul Bloxham, chief economist at HSBC Bank, said larger pools of migration from Asia could prove a boon for the economy and offset the pending cost of retiring baby boomers.</p>
<p>Mr Bloxham’s rationale was that Asians tended to be younger, better educated and came with skills that Australia needed. Asian people, he argued, already had a history of successful integration and could help strengthen our economic ties to many of our most important trading partners.“Strong migration flows, particularly from fast growing Asian nations, could help Australia deal with its demographic challenges and also strengthen links with the fastest growing economies,” Mr Bloxham said. Mr Bloxham agreed that any substantial increase in migrants would need to be supported by increased housing, infrastructure spend and social services. However Mr Bloxham’s comments also mirrored those of RBA governor Glenn Stevens recently when he said that Australia was facing a worker and skills shortage (not to mention the cost impost) as increasing numbers of baby boomers retire from the workplace and are not quickly replaced.</p>
</div>
<div class=""col-md-12"">


<p>Any increase in Asian migration could also prove an opportunity for brokerages who have, in recent times, adapted their businesses to cater to Asian investors and migrants. One of these is aggregation group Vow Financial. Such is the importance of the Chinese market to Vow that its chief executive, Tim Brown, recently revealed he was taking lessons in Mandarin. “The Chinese market in Australia is growing &ndash; it’s 15 per cent of the market today. It could get to 20 per cent or 30 per cent over the next two or three years and it’s such an important piece of our growth strategy,” Mr Brown recently told The Adviser.</p>

"Melbourne set to become Australia’s largest city","882","		<p>Data released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) indicates Melbourne is set to have the largest population of all Australian capitals.</p>
<p>“In 2013, two in three (66 per cent) Australians lived in a capital city, a slight increase since 1973 when 65 per cent lived in a capital. By 2053, this share is projected to increase to 72 per cent” said ABS Director of Demography, Denise Carlton. “That equates to 28 million people living in the capitals in 2053.”</p>
<p>In the last 40 years, 89 per cent of the growth in capitals occurred in the four largest cities (Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and Perth), with Perth and Brisbane more than doubling in population. Darwin had the highest growth rate (191 per cent) of all capital cities. In contrast, Hobart grew by 36 per cent.</p>
<p>Sydney and Melbourne each grew by almost 1.7 million people between 1973 and 2013, although the overall growth rate for Melbourne was higher (62 per cent increase compared with 54 per cent). This reflects Melbourne’s comparatively higher growth rates in recent years. If current trends prevail, Melbourne is projected to overtake Sydney to become Australia’s largest capital city by 2053.</p>
<p>Of the four largest capitals, Perth has seen the fastest growth over the past 40 years. Perth has grown by around 1.2 million people since 1973, exceeding Adelaide’s population in 1984. While Brisbane has grown by a similar number of people, Perth is growing at a faster rate and is projected to overtake Brisbane in 2028.</p>
<p>“Currently, Perth and Darwin are the fastest-growing capital cities. Between 2012 and 2013, Perth grew fastest (3.5 per cent), followed by Darwin (3 per cent), Melbourne (2.2 per cent) and Brisbane (2.1 per cent),” said Ms Carlton.</p>

"Australia : Partner Visas under scrutiny","889","<p> 28 January 2014<br>

DIBP is acting quickly to cancel dubious partner visas with already over 1000 partner visas cancelled, including permanent visas, over the last 3 years.<br>
It has been estimated that over 30 per cent of marriages in Australia involve migrant spouses. And the numbers are increasing as visa regulations in other classes get stricter. This has led to greater scrutiny of both applicants and visa holders by DIBP.</p>
<p>Monash University migration lecturer, Dr Bob Birrell has reportedly said that the huge backlog of cases was putting enormous pressure on migration officials.</p>
<p>“They are literally swamped with the client load, it’s very difficult to seriously evaluate whether the relationship is genuine and continuing,” he said in an interview with the Herald Sun.</p>
<p>Over the last three years, DIBP’s increased vigilance on partner visa holders and applicants have led to high-level of refusals and cancellations. Over 1000 permanent and temporary partner visas have been cancelled on grounds of  bogus claims, bad character and incorrect information.</p>

"Australia : More than 90% Indian students applied for visas successfully, compared with 74% in 2012.","895","<p>20 January 2014<br>

Applications for student visas by Indian student increased between July and September last year. The latest immigration figures show 4,148 Indians made offshore applications for student visas during the two months, more than double the figure for the same period in 2012.<br>
Also, more than 90 per cent of Indians who applied for student visas were successful, compared with 74 per cent in 2012.<br>
Welcoming the development, Australia’s High Commissioner to India, Patrick Suckling said, “Australia welcomes Indian students, who make a vital contribution to both academic life and the communities in which they live.”<br>
The student visa program quarterly report also demonstrates that Australian Government officials are dealing effectively with increased demand. Seventy-five per cent of offshore applications by Indians were processed within 29 days, and 50 per cent were processed within 20 days.<br>
More than 10 per cent of all student visas granted in the three month period went to Indian nationals. India remains the second largest source of overseas students in Australia after China.</p>

"Australia : 457 applications growing too fast","897","<p>23rd January 2014<br>
Recent Parliamentary documents suggests that there remains a concerning trend showing an increasing gap between 457 Visa application lodgements and actual job vacancies and unemployment in Australia.<br>
The trend has had analysts suggesting that employers are seeking the services of overseas workers in place of Australian workers.</p>
<p>Most subclass 457 visa holders originate from the United Kingdom, India, Ireland, the Philippines and the United States of America.</p>
<p>“The subclass 457 program is designed to respond rapidly to temporary economic and employer needs” says the report but adds that it may benefit further from a consistent, planned and measured approach to monitoring and reform. Closer scrutiny of other temporary programs may also be worth consideration by the Parliament.</p>

"Australia : Urgent need to boost immigration to 220,000","899","<p> 13 January 2014<br>
Australia’s productivity is steadily slipping down and will continue to do so if skilled migration numbers are not increased quickly.<br>
The current migration intake of 190,000 a year is not enough to sustain productivity, says the Australian Industry Group (AIG). It says that Australia needs a steady increase in migration intake every year with an emphasis on skilled migration in order to meet current and future skills shortages.</p>
<p>The AIG has proposed that the Federal government needs to act immediately to substantially increase the immigration intake in the upcoming budget by at least 15% to 220,000 to meet the current skills shortage.</p>
<p>The AIG’s chief executive Innes Willox says now is the right time to accelerate skilled migration given Australia’s ageing workforce and skills shortages in industries including mining, construction, engineering and health.</p>

"Australia : Aussies the world’s richest people: Credit Suisse","905","<p>Thu 10 Oct 2013</p>
<p>Australians remain the richest people in the world, by one measure at least.<br>
The median wealth of adult Australians stands at $US219,505 ($233,504) &ndash; the highest level in the world, according to the Credit Suisse 2013 Global Wealth Report, released on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Median wealth is the midpoint between richest and poorest, meaning that 50 per cent of the population has more than $233,504, and 50 per cent less than that.</p>
<p>By the measure of average wealth, Australians fall back to second with $US402,578 per person, ranking behind the Swiss who were the world’s richest on $US513,000.</p>
<p>Credit Suisse chief investment strategist, Australia, David McDonald said the nation’s household wealth per adult grew by 2.6 per cent in the past year. That was slower than the global average of 4.6 per cent, but Australia still had the best distribution of wealth among developed nations.</p>
<p>‘‘Although we are up there at a high level of wealth per adult we’ve also got a better spread than a lot of the other developed countries including, obviously, the Swiss, but also places like the US,’’ Mr McDonald said.<br>
The number of Australian millionaires increased by 38,000 to 1.123 million people. About half of the rise in  </p>
<p>Australian wealth is due to exchange rate appreciation.</p>
<p>The millionaire calculation includes the value of real estate owned outright.</p>
<p>Australians were shown to have a much higher level of wealth held in property and non-financial assets &ndash; 58.5 per cent compared to the world average of 45 per cent and just 38 per cent in the US.<br>
The US remains the millionaire capital of the world, with 13.2 million people topping the seven-figure mark and nearly 46,000 people in the ultra-high net worth $US50 million-plus category.</p>
<p>Australia has 2,059 ultra-high net worth individuals, 2.1 per cent of the global total.<br>
While the Land Down Under has maintained its place at the top in median terms for three years running now, Credit Suisse reported that North America has regained its title as the wealthiest region in the world.<br>
Rising house prices and stock markets fuelled a 12 per cent rise in North American wealth to $US78.9 trillion from mid-2012 to mid-2013, putting the region ahead of the Asia Pacific and Europe for the first time since before the global financial crisis.</p>
<p>Credit Suisse global head of research for private banking, Giles Keating, said Japan’s economic slump had dragged down the Asia-Pacific region.</p>
<p>‘‘The fourth annual Credit Suisse Global Wealth Report shows an $US11 trillion rise in (global) wealth to $US241 trillion, with the US as the clear winner, overtaking Europe, while Asia Pacific fell back due to sharp depreciation of the yen,’’ Mr Keating said.</p>

"Australia : Australia’s unemployment rate drops unexpectedly to 5.6pc","907","<p>Australia’s unemployment rate fell unexpectedly from 5.8 per cent to 5.6 per cent last month, helped by a decline in workforce participation and some modest job creation.</p>
<p>The number of people employed rose by 9,100 in September, seasonally adjusted, with growth in both full-time jobs (up 5,000) and part-time positions (up 4,100), according to the latest labour force figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics.</p>
<p>The participation rate, which is the proportion of people in work or looking for work, fell to 64.9 per cent, the lowest level since November 2006.</p>
<p>While persistently weak job creation shows the labour market remains soft, ANZ head of Australian economics Justin Fabo says there are encouraging signs in other surveys of hiring intentions.</p>
<p>The good news in the data is that there was an estimated 9,100 jobs added to the economy and just over half of those were full-time, so that is positive.</p>
<p>But what’s taking the gloss off is that that’s not actually enough jobs to keep up with workforce growth. </p>
<p>We generally need around 15,000 jobs a month just to keep unemployment roughly steady, and so what happened is that the labour force actually shrank last month due to a fall in the number of people actively looking for work.</p>
<p>Listen to the interview on The World Today<br>
“We’ve seen job ads and a couple of other measures just improve a tad in the last couple of months, and normally that would be consistent with at least a stabilisation in the unemployment rate,” Mr Fabo said.</p>
<p>Several economists say the continued decline in participation suggests people may be giving up the hunt for a job but Mr Fabo believes the ageing population may be hiding the true picture.</p>
<p>“A large part of reason for why it’s fallen is the ageing of the population,” he said.</p>
<p>“So when you strip out those people who are aged over 65 – and not many of them work – when you strip them out the participation rate’s actually increased a little bit over the past year.”</p>
<p>Around the country, unemployment dropped sharply in both South Australia (from 6.8 per cent to 6 per cent) and in Western Australia (from 5 per cent to 4.6 per cent). It also fell in New South Wales (from 5.9 per cent to 5.6 per cent).</p>
<p>The jobless rate rose in Victoria (5.8 per cent) and the ACT (to 4.1 per cent, in trend terms), and it held steady in Queensland (5.9 per cent), the Northern Territory (5.5 per cent) and in Tasmania (8.5 per cent in trend terms).</p>

“Net overseas migration added 238,300 people to Australia’s population in the year to March 2013, this is around the five yearly average. We’re now seeing migration climbing steadily to rates last seen in 2009, though it’s still well below the record high of 316,000 in 2008,” he said.<br>
Australia’s population reached 23 million at the end of March 2013, and grew by an annual rate of 1.8 per cent (or 397,400 people). Net overseas migration accounted for 60 per cent of Australia’s growth, with the remaining 40 per cent due to natural increase.<br>

"Australia : Aussie Visa Fee To Double From July 2013","913","<p>Friday, 24 May 2013</p>
<p>The price of four-year 457 visas, which are offered to skilled workers and their dependants who are sponsored by an Australian company, will rise from €350 (Aus $455) to €690 (Aus $900) from July 1st.</p>
<p>The move is part of a revenue-raising measure introduced by the Australian government in its budget earlier this week.</p>
<p>It’s expected the price hike in temporary working visas will particularly affect Irish nationals, who in per capita terms head the take-up of the scheme.</p>
<p>Between July 1st and October 1st last year, some 4,120 Irish citizens had their applications for a 457 visa granted &ndash; a 30 per cent rise on the same period the previous year.</p>
<p>Of the total 101,970 visa holders, approximately 11,310 &ndash; or one tenth of the overall number &ndash; are Irish.</p>
<p>Ireland, at 10.2 per cent, is the third highest recipient of the working permits, behind the United Kingdom at 21 per cent and heavily-populated India at 19.8 per cent.</p>
<p>Western Australia is the most popular destination for Irish workers, followed by New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland.</p>

"AUSTRALIA :eMedical improves Australian visa processing in 100 countries","916","<p>01-July-2013<br>
Collaboration between Australia and Canada has resulted in more than 100 countries now having access to eMedical, the Department of Immigration and Citizenship’s (DIAC) new electronic health processing system that enables more efficient and cost-effective visa processing.</p>
<p>eMedical is an updated and improved version of the former ‘eHealth’ system used to record online the health examination results of visa applicants who complete their examinations for both DIAC and Citizenship and Immigration Canada (CIC).</p>
<p>“Increased use of eMedical will result in substantial benefits to DIAC and our clients, including improved client service, enhanced integrity and significant financial savings,” a DIAC spokesman said today.  </p>
<p>DIAC has been working closely with CIC since early 2011 to progress this ground-breaking initiative and reached the 100-country milestone mid-year. The shared aim of eMedical was to increase the efficiency of both organisations’ visa processing, while sharing support and development costs. It will make the respective immigration medical exam systems more secure, reduce the possibility of error, protect applicants’ privacy and save applicants time.</p>
<p>The project demonstrated what can be achieved in practical terms when Five Country Conference (5CC) partners &ndash; Australia, United Kingdom, United Sates, Canada and New Zealand &ndash; work together.</p>
<p>“About 78 per cent of Australian eMedical cases are now being auto-cleared, with the results available in minutes and no manual intervention needed, allowing visa processing to continue immediately,” the spokesman said.</p>
<p>DIAC continues to work towards its goal of achieving 100 per cent electronic health processing for Australian immigration health examinations. Shortly DIAC will roll out another major achievement with electronic health processing. Medibank Health Solutions clinics and their regional partners will commence using the eMedical system progressively from mid-July.</p>
<p>In another initiative, DIAC will also release its new My Health Declarations service, which for the first time will enable clients to complete immigration health examinations electronically before lodging their visa application to further facilitate quicker processing times.</p>
<p>Information on this new service and other developments in the immigration health systems space will be available on DIAC’s website from June 30.</p>

Managing Director Ayda Shabanzadeh says the city’s new shopping centres have made Brisbane competitive with Melbourne and Sydney &ndash; traditionally Australia’s main cities.</p>

<p>“So, as well as traditional shopping and dining hubs like Bulimba and Paddington, residents now have a much wider choice of dining, shopping and entertainment precincts, all within easy access of transport.<br>
“Sydney and Melbourne’s trendy precincts, like Chapel St and Surry Hills, are starting to look tired in comparison to Brisbane’s new offerings.”</p>

"Australia : Visitor visas will be simplified Immigration and Citizenship","930","The Minister for Immigration and Citizenship has announced in a media release the Australian visitor visa regime will change dramatically from 23 March 2013. The most significant change is that work activities are no longer permitted on any business visitor visa, and the new Temporary Work (Short Stay Activity) Visa (Subclass 400) is now the required visa for highly skilled work assignments of up to six weeks in duration. The number of visitor visas will be reduced from nine to four.

From 23 March 2013, the Department of Immigration and Citizenship will no longer be accepting new applications for the following visa categories: 

&nbsp;

1. Tourist Visa (subclass 676)

&nbsp;

2. Sponsored Family Visitor Visa (subclass 679)

&nbsp;

3. Business (Short Stay) Visa (subclass 456)

&nbsp;

4. Sponsored Business Visitor (Short Stay) Visa (subclass 459)

&nbsp;

5. Medical Treatment (Short Stay) Visa (subclass 675)

&nbsp;

6. Medical Treatment (Long Stay) Visa (subclass 685)

&nbsp;

7. Electronic Travel Authority (Visitor) (subclass 976)

&nbsp;

8. Electronic Travel Authority (Business – Short Validity) (subclass 977)

&nbsp;

9. Electronic Travel Authority (Business – Long Validity) (subclass 956).

&nbsp;

<b>From 23 March 2013, visa applicants will be required to apply for: </b>

&nbsp;

• Temporary Work (Short Stay Activity) Visa (subclass 400)

&nbsp;

• Visitor Visa (subclass 600)

&nbsp;

• Electronic Travel Authority (ETA) (subclass 601)

&nbsp;

• Medical Treatment Visa (subclass 602)

&nbsp;

• eVisitor Visa (subclass 651).

&nbsp;

Visa subclasses 600, 601 and 651 will permit tourism activities and business-visitor activities. Business-visitor activities may include attending a conference, negotiation or an exploratory business visit. No work activities will be permitted as a business activity.

&nbsp;

All visa applications for the <b>Electronic Travel Authority (ETA)</b> must be lodged online. Only nationals from certain countries are eligible to apply. A list of eligible foreign nationals is available athttp://www.immi.gov.au/visas/visitor/601/applicants.htm. The applicant must be outside of Australia at the time of application and decision.

&nbsp;

<b>The eVisitor</b> will be available by online application for nationals from certain countries. A list of eligible foreign nationals is available athttp://www.immi.gov.au/visas/visitor/651/applicants.htm. The applicant must be outside of Australia at the time of application and decision.

&nbsp;

<b>The Visitor Visa</b> will be available for all nationals. The Visitor Visa, depending on unique circumstances, may be applied for in paper format or online. Further details are available at http://www.immi.gov.au/visas/visitor/600. Depending on individual circumstances, an applicant may be inside or outside of Australia at the time of application and decision.

&nbsp;

<b>The Medical Treatment Visa</b> is available for patients who must travel to Australia for medical procedures or consultations. The Medical Treatment Visa must be applied for in paper format at either the Department of Immigration and Citizenship (if in Australia) or at the appropriate Australian Embassy/Consulate (if outside of Australia). Depending on individual circumstances, an applicant may be inside or outside of Australia at the time of application and decision.

&nbsp;

<b>NEW – Temporary Work (Short Stay Activity) Visa (Subclass 400)</b>
As stated above, the most significant change is the introduction of the <b>Temporary Work (Short Stay Activity) Visa (subclass 400)</b> for highly skilled work assignments of up to 6 weeks in duration. In exceptional circumstances, this may be increased to 12 weeks.

&nbsp;

The new subclass 400 visa will permit the visa holder to:

&nbsp;

• engage in highly specialised short-term work

&nbsp;

• conduct an activity as an invited participant in an event (for example, being a sportsperson invited for a specific sporting tournament).

&nbsp;

The applicant must be outside of Australia at the time of application and time of decision. The application must be lodged in paper format with the appropriate Australian Embassy/Consulate.
To be eligible for the grant of the visa, applicants will need to evidence the following:

&nbsp;

• the work or event participation is short-term and not ongoing (usually less than 6 weeks, but in exceptional circumstances may be extended to 12 weeks)

&nbsp;

• that s/he will be in Australia to conduct the work or activity

&nbsp;

• appropriate background for the proposed Australian activity

&nbsp;

• sufficient funds for the proposed stay in Australia

&nbsp;

• invitation/support of the proposed Australian employer or event organiser

&nbsp;

• confirmation that no study will occur which will lead to a formal qualification

&nbsp;

• that s/he satisfies health and character requirements.

&nbsp;

It is important to note that entertainers and people supporting entertainers are specifically barred from applying for the 400 visa.

&nbsp;

Tradespersons are also prohibited from applying for the 400 visa. The visa is intended for professionals working in short-term highly specialised roles, which cannot be sourced from within Australia.

&nbsp;

The visa application will include a completed paper form and appropriate supporting documents. Processing times are somewhat difficult to predict and we suspect they will vary from location to location. We would estimate processing times of 1 to 2 weeks. The government processing cost has yet to be announced. The current subclass 456 visa has a government processing fee of A$140. We expect the government application fee to be similar for the new subclass 400 visa.

&nbsp;

It is also important to note that for any work assignment that is over 6 weeks in duration and 12 weeks in exceptional circumstances, or is ongoing, or does not satisfy the guidelines for the grant of the 400 visa, the appropriate visa to apply for is the Temporary Work (Skilled) Visa (Subclass 457).

&nbsp;

<b>Immigrationxperts.com Comment</b>: Businesses will be required to ensure that visa applicants collate appropriate supporting documents and lodge the visa application with the relevant Australian Embassy/Consulate well in advance of the proposed Australian assignment. It will no longer be possible to travel to Australia within 24 hours for an urgent highly skilled work assignment. This is the situation now for most individuals eligible for electronic business visitor visas.

&nbsp;

“The Gillard Government is determined to cut red tape and make it easier for visitors to understand which visa they need for a short stay visit or work visa,” Minister for Immigration and Citizenship <b>Brendan O’Connor said.</b>

&nbsp;

The Minister for Immigration and Citizenship entitled his media release <b>‘Cutting Red Tape for Visitor Visas’.</b> Unfortunately, the subclass 400 visa creates substantially more ‘red tape’ for businesses that need to employ overseas nationals in highly skilled, short-term roles that cannot be filled by an Australian.

"Australia : Tips for Submitting EOI Australia’s Department of Immigration","934","		<p>March 10, 2013 &ndash; </p>
<p>Australia’s Department of Immigration and Citizenship has compiled a list of ten tips to guide future applicants and ensure they have everything they need to submit a successful EOI. With so many new rules and changes to the immigration system, it’s important to be up-to-date before beginning your migration journey. So, here’s what you need to keep in mind before submitting your EOI in SkillSelect:<br>

1. Ensure you submit your EOI for the correct visa. You can either use the SkillSelect website or the Visa Wizard to determine which is the right visa for you.</p>

<p>2. Check the Skilled Occupation List to see if your occupation is in-demand in Australia thus making you eligible for skilled migration.</p>

<p>3. Do your homework and research the specific requirements for the visa you’re interesting in applying for.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Make sure you have all the documents you need before submitting your EOI and applying for a visa. An incomplete EOI means you will have to go through the whole process again.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. Don’t know how to get started with SkillSelect? Give the “Getting started” user guide a read to ensure you know all the steps you need to follow to submit your EOI.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>6. Keep your EOI identification number safe! This is a unique number that is automatically generated when you create an account, and it will serve as a username for when you need to login to your account on SkillSelect.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>7. Take your time filling out the EOI questionnaire. If you don’t understand a question, simply click on the “?” icon to get extra details on the answer you need to provide.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>8. Update your information on EOI whenever your circumstances change to ensure your details are up-to-date in case you receive an invitation. Keep in mind that when you receive an invitation, you will no longer be allowed to access your EOI to change your details.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>9. Make sure the information you provide in your EOI is true and you have all the documentation you need to support it. Don’t include that you’ve passed an IELTS test if you’ve not already taken in.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>You may receive an invitation to apply for a visa sooner than you expect and then you won’t be able to support the claims you’ve included in your EOI application.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>10. Check the Reports tab on SkillSelect to see the number of invitations that are being sent out every month, as well as the occupations that are reaching their ceilings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>For example, at the time of this post, the following three occupations have reached their annual occupational ceiling: Chemical and Materials Engineers, ICT Business &amp; System Analysts and Electronic Engineers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The following three occupations will reach their ceilings soon so if you’re qualified in any of these skills, you might want to apply soon before you miss your chance:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>

<li> Telecommunications Engineering Professionals (only 33 more invitations available)</li>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<li> Other Engineering Professionals (only 105 more invitations available)</li>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<li> Software and Applications Programmers (only 1262 more invitations available)</li>
<p>&nbsp;</p></ul>

"Australia: No immigration from Ebola nations","987","		<p>SYDNEY: Australia said Monday (Oct 27) it was suspending migration from Ebola-hit West African nations to try to prevent the virus from crossing its borders, as a teenager who arrived from Guinea tested negative for the disease.</p>
<p>Immigration Minister Scott Morrison told parliament the government had stopped issuing visas to people from those countries hit by the disease, which has claimed close to 5,000 lives in its worst outbreak.</p>
<p>""These measures include temporarily suspending our immigration programme, including our humanitarian programme, from EVD (Ebola Virus Disease) affected countries,"" he said. ""This means we are not processing any application from these affected countries.""</p>
<p>People who had already been granted visas on humanitarian grounds would be able to travel to Australia, but would be subject to three separate health checks before departure as well as screening on arrival. But officials would cancel and refuse non-permanent or temporary visas for people who had not yet departed for Australia, Morrison said.</p>

<p>March 26, 2013 – Western Australian MP Gary Gray and South Australian Senator Don Farrell have been appointed minister for tourism and minister assisting on tourism respectively, marking the reinstatement of the latter position.
Martin Ferguson resigned his ministries last week after supported former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd’s second attempt to oust Ms Gillard in little over a year. In the run up to September’s federal elections, Ms Gillard’s ability to secure re-election is widely considered uncertain.While a large section of the public prefer Mr Rudd – Ms Gillard’s predecessor – as a better candidate for prime </p>

<p>minister, he lacked the numbers within the Labor Party to regain the position. In the wake of the failed spill, several senior government ministers, including Mr Ferguson and former Immigration Minister Chris Bowen, resigned their portfolios after supporting Mr Rudd.<br>
The replacement of Mr Ferguson has been welcomed by Australian tourism industry bodies, particularly the reinstatement of the assistant ministry position.</p>

<p>“It is pleasing that the prime minister has seen fit to reinstate the role of minister assisting on tourism, given out industry is one of the largest and most important in Australia, directly employing more than half a million people,” said the Accommodation Association of Australia chief executive, Richard Munro.</p>

<p>Despite welcoming the announcement, Mr Munro did praise the work of Mr Ferguson, who oversaw some of the Australian tourism industry’s most successful years, growing the industry’s contribution to the country’s economy to AU$187 million (£129 million) a day.</p>
<p>“Martin set a road-map for the industry with the development of the National Long-Term Tourism Strategy which is currently in the implementation phase.”</p></div></div>

"Is Express Entry the Answer to Canada’s Immigration Problems?","1078","<p align=""justify"">'By the dawning of the year 2015, Canada will bring enforce the new “express- entry” program. The Canadian government has high hopes regarding this new program as it is being anticipated as a diverse and improved way to attract immigrants to Canada.</p>
<p align=""justify"">Despite the fact that the government has spent sizable time touting the benefits of the improved program, there seems to be only minuscule information reaching the general public about the dynamics of the new program.</p>
<p align=""justify"">Here is what we know about the new program, the <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.immigrationxperts.com/canadas-express-entry-immigration-is-proving-to-be-a-boon-for-skilled-immigrants/"" title=""Canada Express Entry""><strong>express-entry program</strong></a> is aimed to attract foreign nationals to apply for <strong><em>Canadian permanent residence</em></strong> under a new establishment that will take into account their skillsets and various other aspects, demand of Canadian employers will also be kept in mind. The interested foreign nationals willing to migrate to Canada for PR will submit an initial application online. The details we received about the terms and conditions are fairly limited.</p>
<p align=""justify"">With the help of this application, the skilled migrants will get a chance to endorse their skillset and appear more attractive to prospective foreign employers. To get more information consult <em><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Canada immigration consultants in Delhi</span></strong>.</em></p>
<p align=""justify"">This program will enable the process of skilled migrant’s self-promotion, as a result of which the employer who keenly recruit will be able to receive information about the migrants. The employers can then easily select migrants from a huge pool of potential employees and support the applicant’s permanent residence application.</p>
<p align=""justify"">The government has pointed out that as a part of this program, permanent residence applications will take roughly six months to process, allowing for swift entry to Canada of <em>skilled foreign nationals</em>. However, there is no sign of how long the recruitment stage will take, or how often migrants will be nominated to obtain an invitation to apply. Some aspects are unclear but the program seems legit and promising.</p>

"Canada’s Express Entry Immigration Is Proving to Be a Boon for Skilled Immigrants","1083","<p>A few years back people had to endure rejections and didn’t quite make it to the quota of 400 worldwide applicants when they applied for immigration to Canada, even though they had post-graduate degrees and had good qualifications.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From January 2015, people equipped with degrees, skills and qualifications won’t have to meet the same fate as those people who did not make it to Canada. Yes that’s right, be prepared to step into Canadian shores thanks to <strong>“<a href=""https://www.immigrationxperts.com/canada/canada-skilled-migration/express-entry-2015/"" title=""Express Entry 2015"">express entry</a>”</strong> <em><strong>skilled immigration system</strong></em> that’s all set to come into effect really soon. Formed by same regulations as Australia’s <em>SkillSelect</em> and New Zealand’s point based system, the new programme is an alteration from passive processing to active recruitment. According to the new system, several of the skilled successful applicants in the economic and business immigrant categories could acquire their papers processed swiftly in as little time as six months. This express entry immigration system is a boon for immigrants with a potential to revolutionize the manner in which skilled immigrants are attracted and get them working in Canada quicker. This changes everything; people who earlier were facing problems<a href=""https://www.immigrationxperts.com/why-immigrate-to-canada/"" title=""Why Immigrate to Canada""> immigrating to Canada </a>now have a splendid opportunity to live and work in Canada with a scope of settling down in Canada and admire its beauty.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Under the new express system, applicants will be able to submit an <em>“expression of interest”</em> to the Canadian government; soon after their resume and personal details will be fed into a database. In accordance, Employers in the hunt for foreign skilled workers will have access to details on the database, allowing them to pick suitable candidates. Another advantage of this programme is that there will be greater number of people in the pool to select from than before, so you get a wide variety of people to choose from who have endless talent and qualifications, who knows you may find someone <em><strong>better for a job</strong></em> than you would generally find. Moreover, if a Canadian employer is unable to find the suitable Canadians to work for them, after a labor market impact assessment, they can go online to the<em> Citizenship and Immigration Canada (CIC)</em> database of applicants and look for skilled migrants according to their requirement of project managers etc. in India or anywhere in the world.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a great opportunity for skilled people in India to <strong>migrate to Canada</strong>, work and live a lavish life with your family.</p>

"CIC Makes changes in the Definition of a Dependent Child","1090","<p>It was recently announced by Citizenship and <em><strong>Immigration Canada’s</strong></em> (CIC’s) immigration programs that they are conducting changes to the definition of a dependent child. Earlier, the age at which a child was considered a dependent was 22, now it is 19 years from now onwards.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another good news is that exception for full-time students has also been removed. This amendment brings about a major change for the students who were earlier declared as dependent children as applicants who are 19 or above who are financially dependent on their parents and are enrolled in full-time studies will no longer come in the category of dependent child. In addition, students who are 19 will be considered dependent even if they are <strong><em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">financially dependent on their parents</span></em></strong>, this is a major amendment and will facilitate more students to enroll in full time studies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In every case, a child will be considered a dependent, regardless of age, if they have depended on their parents for financial support of a physical or mental condition.<br>
In accordance, all permanent resident applications in CIC inventories before August 1, 2014 will continue to reap benefits from the pro-amendment definition of dependent child.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition, as of August 1, 2014 to make certain that children who fall under the definition of dependent child at the early stage of a multi-step <em><strong>permanent resident immigration program</strong></em> stay eligible throughout what can be a multi-year process; the child’s age will be set at the first formal step of the<em><strong> immigration process</strong></em>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This opens the door to thousands of young aspiring adults who are talented and have made up mind to migrate to Canada on the basis of their merits, as foreign students or thorough various other programs.

"Canada: The Quebec programme has been closed for more than a year!","1113","		<p>Sunday, June 02, 2013</p>
<p>Although it has not been officially announced, rumours are that the Quebec Immigrant Investor Programme will reopen and begin accepting a limited number of applications on August 1, 2013.</p>
<p>The programme, which leads to a Canadian permanent resident visa, has been closed for more than a year.</p>
<p>Applicants must be able to demonstrate that they have legally acquired a net worth of CAD $1.6 million, alone or with the help of their spouse or common-law partner. When accepted, the applicant will have to invest CAD $800,000 through a government-approved financial institution into a government-controlled corporation for a period of five years at a zero rate of return.</p>

When accepted, the applicant will have to invest CAD $800,000 through a government-approved financial institution into a government-controlled corporation for a period of five years at a zero rate of return.</p>
<p>In addition, applicants must have at least two years of management experience within the last five years.</p>
<p>“Interestingly, the management experience does not have to be in a commercial or industrial enterprise. As long as the experience is managerial in nature, it can be in agriculture, government or in an international organisation,” points out the Citizenship and Immigration Canada (CIC) on its website.</p>
<p>“Because the Quebec government stands behind the repayment of capital, financing the investment is an option,” recommends CIC.</p>
<p>Due to the closure of the programme and a limited number of applicants accepted, the program is known to be filled within days after opening.</p>
<p>“The last time a Canadian immigrant investor programme opened to a limited number of applicants, it filled in a matter of days.</p>
<p>“Unless a candidate is willing to begin preparing an application in advance, there is little chance that there will be sufficient time to gather supporting documents and submit the required forms before the quota is reached.</p>

"Canada :$ 600,000 Dollar Immigration Fraud","1119","		<p>Montréal,<br>
 May 22, 2013</p>
<p> Montréal residents Jean-Michel Labelle and Ekatarina Mdivani have been charged with defrauding nearly 400 people from China by billing them for so-called immigration services. They are scheduled to appear at the Montréal Court House tomorrow to each face nine counts of fraud and making and uttering false documents under the Criminal Code of Canada. The fraud is estimated at $600,000.</p>
<p>The investigation was conducted by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) Immigration &amp; Passport Section.</p>
<strong><p>Forged Training Certificates</p></strong>
<p>Jean-Michel Labelle, 58, manager of Immigration internationale 9-1-1 Inc. and Ekatarina Mdivani, 48, allegedly defrauded the victims through a representative who travelled to China.</p>
<p>The victims were led to believe that they were engaging into a legitimate employment process through which they could to immigrate to Canada. They paid a sum of money in exchange for training in a particular field of employment. Forged training certificates were issued on behalf of a Canadian federal agency and on behalf of bogus companies.</p>
<p>The investigation shows that Jean-Michel Labelle did not submit any of his files to Citizenship and Immigration Canada, and that he kept the money he collected.</p>
<strong><p>Immigration Fraud</p></strong>
<p>The mandate of the RCMP in Quebec is to detect and disrupt criminal activity in relation to immigration, passport and citizenship. The RCMP investigates suspicious activity involving individuals who fraudulently offer immigration advice and services. These profit-motivated criminals abuse the trust of people who put their hopes in immigrating to Canada.</p>

<p>However, mastery of French is lower among other categories of immigrants, like investors, of whom nine out of 10 do not speak Quebec’s official language.</p>

"NZ immigration at 10-year high","1145","		<p>New Zealand has recorded the biggest monthly jump in net migration in a decade, as more people choose to stay in the country rather than move to Australia.</p>
<p>China became the biggest source of net migration, with 6,100 migrants, for the first time in a decade, followed by India with more than 5,800 migrants.</p>
<p>Australian visitors also flocked to New Zealand last month, pushing overall visitor numbers to a February record of more than 301,000 people.</p>
<p>NZ gained a seasonally-adjusted 3,500 net new migrants in February, the most since April 2003, and up from 3,100 in January, according to Statistics New Zealand.</p>
<p>Seasonally-adjusted there was a net outflow of 600 people to Australia in February, down from 850 in January.</p>
<p>On an annual basis, New Zealand net migration rose 13 per cent to 96,900 people for the year ended February, while departures fell 20 per cent to 67,800.</p>
<p>China became the biggest source of net migration for the first time in a decade, with a net gain of 6,100 people, followed by India with more than 5,800, and pipping the UK which had previously provided the biggest net migrant gain.</p>
<p>Chinese long-term arrivals rose 8.7 per cent to 8,556 in the year ended February 28, and are up 14 per cent over the past two years. At the same time, UK arrivals, slipped 0.6 per cent to 13,929, and are down 3.1 per cent over the past two years.</p>
<p>Last week, the Reserve Bank said net migration had rapidly increased over the past 18 months, boosting demand for housing and consumer spending, and was seen as an inflationary pressure that prompted the bank to lift the official cash rate a quarter-point to 2.75 per cent.</p>
<p>“This monthly result suggests migration flows may be starting to run a little ahead of our forecasts, although it is difficult to judge whether that will be sustained,” ASB economist Dan Smith said in a note.</p>
<p>“Strong inwards migration will continue to add to domestic demand and housing market pressures, and is one of the reasons why interest rates will rise over the next couple of years.”</p>
<p>Auckland attracted most of the nation’s new migrants with a net gain of 13,700 in the year. Canterbury followed with a net gain of 5,100 migrations, while Otago recorded a net increase of 600 migrants and Wellington attracted 400 new net migrants</p>

"UK: UK to charge Indians Rs.2.7 lakh bond to enter Britain","1148","25 June 2013
India along with six other nations will have to pay 3,000 pounds as a bond from November to enter Britain.
According to a ‘Sunday Times’ report, the British government is planning to pilot a scheme from November targeted at visitors from at least six countries, also including Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Ghana.

Tourists aged 18 and over would be forced to hand over 3,000 pounds for a six-month visit visa, which they will forfeit if they overstay in Britain.

The weekly paper said the move by Home Secretary Theresa May is designed to show that Prime Minister David Cameron’s Conservative Party is serious about cutting immigration and abuses of the system.

Cameron wants annual net migration down below 100,000 by 2015.

Last year 296,000 people granted six-month visas were from India, 101,000 from Nigeria, 53,000 from Pakistan and 14,000 each from Sri Lanka and Bangladesh",,"2013-06-24 08:48:28","uk-uk-to-charge-indians-rs-2-7-lakh-bond-to-enter-britain","1","publish",,,,"1","open","0","off","off","30","#000","0","off","0","52",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Immigration News|UK",

"Indian Community- The Most Highly Educated Community in Australia","5994","<span style=""color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;"">It is quite interesting and delightful to note that the Indian community is regarded as the most educated community in Australia. The indicative analysis of this fact is done by the Editor of “Pehchan” News Paper Umar Amin, who has collected the figures from the Department of Immigration and Border Protection’s documents. </span>

<span style=""color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;"">According to the Melbourne’s News Paper, 54.6 per cent of migrants from India embrace a bachelor’s degree or any other higher educational degree in Australia. This ratio is three times higher than the national average of Australia which was noted at 17.2 per cent in the 2011 census. It is apparent from this analysis that Indian’s hold the first position on the podium while Americans were second with 52.2 per cent having a Bachelor’s or higher qualifications. </span>

<span style=""color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;"">An additional analysis by the same News Paper shows that if one broke up the qualifications among the two main religious groups migrating to Australia from India, Hinduism holds the first position with 88.1 per cent followers holding the qualification of year 12 and above, while Sikhism stood second in the list with 85.9 per cent of its population falling in this category. </span>

"The Need for Augmentation of Immigration to Alberta, Canada","6001","<p style=""text-align: justify;"">John McCallum, the minister of immigration addressed a news conference on Wednesday, August 17, 2016 in Vancouver where he discussed about immigration boost coming to Atlantic Canada.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">“Canada is an aging country, so we are in need of new blood because Canadians aren’t having enough babies and so the labor force growth depends very much on the entrance of immigrants,” he said. Conforming to what McCallum said, the Canadian federation of Independent businesses said that there are still many rural businesses in Alberta that are searching for workers in highly-skilled or semi-skilled trades.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The major issue is that there’s a big misalliance between the people that have been looking for work and positions that are vacant. More than half of the immigrants have an inclination towards settling in major cities of Canada like Vancouver, Montreal and Toronto.  Therefore, the immigration experts like McCallum and others find an urge to search ways to induce immigrants to go where they are most required. In order to make this possible, a meat packing plant in Alberta provided its immigrant workers with free English classes after they completed their shifts.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">According to McCallum, the best way to induce immigrants to small towns is by offering them some benefits and developing mechanisms to welcome and retain them.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">To this need for augmentation of immigration in Alberta, highlighted by John McCallum, Gil McGowan of the Alberta federation of Labour disagrees by saying, ““We’re not opposed to immigration; we recognize that immigration is the way we built our country,” McGowan said. “We’re not even opposed to immigration targets in the hundreds of thousands every year… the question is, is this the right time to increase them?”</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">According to McGowan, “Now might not be the time”.</p>",,"2016-08-25 05:28:50","the-need-for-augmentation-of-immigration-to-alberta-canada","1","publish","https://www.immigrationxperts.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Alberta.jpg",,,"1","open","0","off","off","30","#000","0","off","0","63",,"According to McCallum, the best way to induce immigrants to small towns is by offering them some benefits and developing mechanisms to welcome and retain them.","The Need for Augmentation of Immigration to Alberta, Canada",,,,,,,,,,"Immigration News|Canada",
"Coalition Assures 5 Years Continuous Stay Visa for Parents","6004","<p style=""text-align: justify;"">In the election 2016, the coalition government attempts to encourage immigrants by offering their families a 5 year continuous stay visa in Australia. Currently it is offered to only those applicants on a case-to-case basis who have lodged a concurrent permanent parental visa application.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The minister of immigration recognizes that many Australians face certain pressures through the separation of children from parents and families. Therefore, in an attempt to reunite families, the government promises to offer them a 5 years continuous stay visa.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Speaking on this, the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection said, ““We want to help families reunite and spend time together, while ensuring that we do so in a way that does not burden Australia’s health care system.”</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Echoing similar safeguarding measures of Labor, Coalition’s plan would also warrant visitors applying for the enhanced parental visitor visa to demonstrate that they hold adequate private health insurance from an Australian provider. Also these families would have to pay a mandatory bond based on the existing Assurance of support scheme.</p>

"Canada’s Immigration Minister Wants to “Substantially Increase” Immigration to Fill Its Labour Wants","6070","<p style=""text-align: justify;"">John McCallum, Canada’s Minister of Immigration, has stated his aim to considerably increase immigration to Canada in order to fill the country’s labour needs and rise to the demographic challenges faced by an aging population.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">McCallum made the comments in Manila, Philippines during a speech to the Canadian chamber of commerce, “Why not substantially increase the number of immigrants coming to Canada? And that is, I think, I hope, what we are about to do . . . the direction in which I would like to go is to increase substantially the number of immigrants”. He further added by saying, “We’re going to reduce some of the barriers in our immigration system . . . we think it can be simplified. We think there are some rules which are no longer necessary.”</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Earlier this year, the liberal government of Canada revealed its immigration plan for 2016, which anticipated that the country would invite around 300,000 new permanent residents this year. This marked the highest projected immigration level in decades, and around a seven percent increase on the 2015 plan.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>Economic immigration to Canada</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Most of the new residents to Canada arrive through one of the many economic immigration programs, which strive to garner skilled new arrivals that have the capability of settling in Canada effectively.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Though the 2016 immigration plan anticipates an increase the overall number of new immigrants to Canada this year, yet the economic categories together saw a decrease in the numbers, with the government first seeking to improve numbers through family unification and humanitarian programs.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">However, it is believed that the new plan this year will seek to increase the number of new immigrants to Canada through economic programs, as these programs specify positive labour market outcomes as a foremost aim.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>Express Entry: a positive future</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The Immigration Minister’s recent comments about increasing immigration numbers with the aim of solving labour shortages may give current and future Express Entry candidates real hope that Canada will accept more immigrants through the system in the near future, with the consequence that CRS cut-off scores may become lower. In addition, the government has pledged to review the system and make changes where appropriate. These changes may occur at any time, and, as a result, candidates in the pool may see their ranking change for the better, placing them in line to receive an ITA at a subsequent draw.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>Immigration Minister has plans in other areas too</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">During a visit to Beijing earlier in his Asian tour, McCallum announced that the government of Canada plans to increase the number of visa offices in China, in order to facilitate the numbers of Chinese visitors, workers, students and prospective immigrants expected to come to Canada in the future.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">McCallum’s department is expected to make a number of other changes before the end of 2016, including <a href=""http://www.cicnews.com/2016/07/bill-change-canadian-citizenship-act-passes-house-commons-senate-approval-pending-078363.html"">modifications to the Canadian Citizenship Act</a> and changes to the Temporary Foreign Worker <a href=""http://www.canadavisa.com/temporary-foreign-worker-program.html"">Program</a>.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong> Growing the country- the right move, the right time</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">“After spending a few months finding their feet in a few areas, it looks like the department of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada is making positive moves on a number of fronts,” says Attorney David Cohen.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">“Minister McCallum’s ambitious goal to increase overall immigration numbers over the coming years is the right move at the right time. The labour market realities and demographic challenges faced by communities from coast to coast demand a positive government response. If you look at Minister McCallum’s provincial counterparts, many are asking the federal government to be allowed to take in more newcomers. There is not a single provincial government saying they have enough people. Quite the opposite, in fact.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">“Overall, the federal government and Canadian provinces alike seem to be on the same page with a clear message to spread around the world — the time is right to come to Canada.”</p>",,"2016-09-01 12:24:14","canadas-immigration-minister-wants-to-substantially-increase-immigration-to-fill-its-labour-wants","1","publish","https://www.immigrationxperts.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Gallery.jpg",,,"1","open","0","off","off","30","#000","0","off","0","75",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Immigration News|Canada",

"Canada: A safe Haven for Syrian Refugees","6234","6,000 more refugees are expected to arrive in Canada by the end of December 2016.
Canada is doing as much as it can to sponsor and help these refugees in need. This has been depicted by the actions of John McCallum, the current immigration minister of Canada. McCallum lambasted on Kellie Leitch’s proposal of screening immigrants. McCallum called the idea Anti-Canadian and thought it to be ‘Orwellian.’

The difficulties for the syrian refugees are immense and the Canadian liberals do realise this. McCallum stated that,<i> “</i><i>It’s always a difficult process when you come from a war-torn country, you don’t speak the language, you may not have much education, it does take a certain amount of time</i><i>.” </i>The government of canada is expecting about 6000 more refugees to arrive to canada by the end of this year. The government is giving up to 12 months of financial support to these refugees to enable a smooth transition for them into Canadian economy and the way of life.

For years Canada has served as a safe haven for refugees from different war torn countries such as vietnam and Syria. After the incident of Alan Kurdi being washed up on the shore, the whole world has come together to enable a more lucid process of infusing Syrian refugees and helping them through these difficult times and also in transition.

There are three different ways in which Canadians can sponsor Syrian refugees. The methods have been stated below:-
<ul>
 	<li>Sponsorship Agreement Holders(SAHs): reaching out to an SAH is your best option to sponsor a refugee. These organisations, groups or individuals are well versed in filing for the sponsorship.</li>
 	<li>Groups of Five(G5): five or more Canadian citizens or permanent residents can collect enough funds and sponsor refugees.</li>
 	<li>Community Sponsors (CSs): these are organisations, companies and even associations that sponsor syrian refugees.</li>
</ul>
Syrian family links Initiative has been helping a lot of Syrian refugees bring in their whole family to live in Canada. The Canadian authorities have even reduced the number of documents required in order to make the whole process more lucid.

Sponsoring refugees is not as easy as it may sound. There are a number of prerequisites that you need to fulfil in order to be a sponsor. You will need to provide the following in order to become a sponsor by providing:-
<ul>
 	<li>Cost of food</li>
 	<li>Clothing and other necessary goods</li>
 	<li>Essential utilities</li>
 	<li>Interpreters</li>
 	<li>Information to the refugees about essential services like communication, transportation and banking.</li>
</ul>
You may also be required to inform the sponsored refugee about the healthcare and social welfare programs. You should also consider referring them to a physician and dentist for healthcare requirements. To make the transition smoother, consider introducing the refugees with other people who have been living in Canada.

Finding private sponsors for Syrian Refugees can be an arduous task, though Blended Visa Office Referred (BVOR) program makes it as easy as pie. This program links the refugees with private sponsors. The list of refugees is attained from United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR.) The Resettlement Assistance Program has been put in place to financially support the refugees immigrating through this program for the first six months. After this period, the private sponsor will take on the financial support responsibility from the government of canada.

This new Program for refugees also includes G5 and CSs as sponsors. This will help create a pool of sponsors and will help the refugees in the short and long run. All of the above information is enough to substantiate the fact that Canada is doing as much as it can for Syrian Refugees.",,"2016-09-16 10:56:50","canada-a-safe-haven-for-syrian-refugees","1","publish","https://www.immigrationxperts.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/syrian-father-and-son-at-refugee-camp.jpg",,,"1","open","0","off","off","30","#000","0","off","0","59",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Blog|Canada",
"Canadian Expats need to apply for eTA","6237","A new move by the Government of Canada makes it compulsory for Canadian expats to carry Canadian passport. Without a passport of their home country, they will not be allowed entry into Canadian borders. Being recognized as the citizen of two countries is known as being a dual citizen.

The citizens of Canada have been enabled by their constitution to take up foreign nationality while retaining their Canadian one. The people who select to gain a foreign nationality and are living outside the Canadian borders are known as Canadian expatriate. These expats had no obligation of carrying their passports but all of this has changed with the advent of a new system, Electronic Travel Authorization (eTA).

A spokesperson from Immigration and Citizenship Canada stated, ‘<i>The Government of Canada is implementing a new electronic system to assist airlines in verifying that all travelers have the appropriate documents to travel to or transit through Canada by air,’</i>

This will also make it obligatory for the airlines to check that each passenger heading to Canada has the appropriate documents required to enter the confines of that country. The spokesperson also added, <i>‘Every Canadian citizen has the right to enter Canada and is not subject to immigration screening. Travelling with a valid Canadian passport proves that you are a citizen. If you don’t have a valid travel document that proves your Canadian citizenship at check-in, you may not be able to board your flight. People need to be prepared and should renew or apply for a Canadian passport as soon as possible,</i>’ the spokesman added.

A passport is a universal proof of nationality. This particular document will give you the right to enter Canada even when you are an expat. This new system will be made mandatory and no leniency will be shown to the expats after 30 September 2016. You should consider applying for a temporary passport or emergency travel document if your passport has expired.

Of you do not have a Canadian passport or have lost one for more than a year then you should consider applying for a new passport. To apply for this particular document you need to be:
<ul>
 	<li>a Canadian Citizen</li>
 	<li>Above the age of 16.</li>
</ul>
To apply for passport for kids under the age of 16 you must provide documented proof that you are the legal guardian or custodian parent of the child.

To get your passport renewed, you must meet the following criteria’s:
<ul>
 	<li>Must have been 16 or over at the time passport was issued.</li>
 	<li>Your passport must not have expired for more than a year.</li>
 	<li>Must not change the essential information like name, sex, date and place of birth.</li>
 	<li>Your passport must never have been reported stolen.</li>
 	<li>Passport must not be damaged</li>
</ul>
To renew your passport, you can apply through mail. You need to apply in person to renew your passport within 20 days. You will be required to fill in an application form and submit it in person or by mail.

You need to attach 2 identical passport photos and the most recent passport that you want to get renewed. Two references, who have known you for more than 2 years need to include in the renewal application. The references must not have been your guarantor or a family member and must be 18 years of age or above.

You can make your payment online through credit or debit cards and offline through money orders. These passport offices do not accept cash or personal check. You will receive your renewed passport through mail if you would have signed up for a pickup service.

The eTA can be applied for online and is processed and granted within a few minutes. Sometimes it can take up to a few days due to some discrepancy in the information provided by the applicant. The eTA is not only useful for Canadian expats but also for people from visa exempt countries. You should apply for an eTA at least a week before you need to fly to Canada.",,"2016-09-16 11:00:25","canadian-expats-need-to-apply-for-eta","1","publish","https://www.immigrationxperts.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/canada-flag.jpg",,,"1","open","0","off","off","30","#000","0","off","0","68",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Blog|Canada",
"Immigration to Canada: Tips for Improving Express Entry CRS Scores","6269","January 2015 was a month of change and greater opportunity for applicants wishing to migrate to Canada, as the Canadian Government inducted a proper system called Express Entry. This system was introduced for accurate management of three main immigration programs of Canada, namely – Federal Skilled Trades Class (FSTC), Federal Skilled Worker Class (FSWC) &amp; Canadian Experience Class (CEC).

Where the older system followed the process of First Come – First Serve, this new introduction digs deeper into the professional and educational life of the applicants and select them on the basis of their CRS (Comprehensive Ranking System). Under this system applicants are awarded with points in accordance with their documents and test. It is quite different from the way the three mentioned immigration programs work and also provides incentives for applicants to garner as many points as they can. This in turns also helps the chances of getting ITA that is Invitation to Apply, for PR of Canada.

Applicants opting for Express Entry should be aware that the key here is going beyond the points required for just being eligible. Better points and ranking make them much closer to achieving an ITA.

<b>Points Distribution under CRS</b>

Under CRS the applicant gains points on the basis of his or her age, qualification and education level, language skills for both English and French or in either of the one, job offer for Canada has been obtained, Canadian or Non-Canadian work experience etc. Another base that affects the points obtained by the applicant is whether they have been issued a certificate of nomination from any province of Canada through any of the reputed PNP (Provincial Nominee Program). More points are awarded for acquiring recognized certificate for any trade qualification of a province.

Some attributes included under CRS, along with their combination, overpower the importance over other factors, which results in better scoring and thus ranking. Furthermore, those who are migrating to Canada with a spouse, conjugal partner, or an in-law face the weight-age of points in different manner as there certain factors where spouse’s attributes are also taken into account.

In total an applicant can get up to 1200 points. The solid 600 are for those with provincial nomination or a job offer. The remaining 600 are divided as such – 100 for transferable skills combination and rest 500 for certain factors of human capital. There have been around 40 Express Entry draws from which 35 have achieved ITA for the applicants who did not have either provincial nomination or job offer.

<b>Improving CRS Score</b>

The small differences in the system found indicates and points out various small options through which the applicant can improve his or her CRS score and consequently the ranking. The importance of these changes are such that even a slight improvement in any of the elements of the CRS can result in huge difference in the ranking for example jumping from intermediate level to initial advanced level in language skills. There are many options which may seem pretty obvious; however, there are some which do not.

<b>Education Level</b>

Education attribute is one the most important factor under CRS score and ranking. To cover all the details regarding this factor let’s begin with CEC program applicants first. For the applicants under FSWC program who have completed their education out of Canada, it is imperative to prove the worth and credibility of their education qualification through an ECA (Educational Credential Assessment) which is not needed under CEC program wherein the applicants do not have to give either ECA or Canada credential. At time CEC applicants also opt to enter into the program and then wait for ITA, which is generally a long wait and often leads to disappointment. They however, can gain more points by having their education qualification and level assessed. This can help to gain up to 200 points of which 150 is for human capital and rest 50 for a combination of work experience and language skills or either of the one. If the applicants get the assessment done of their bachelor degree they can gain up to 170 points. For those CEC applicants with proper education qualification, I would advise to get their ECA done ASAP.

Other beneficial ways through which applicants under all three programs, mentioned above, can garner much more points. Those applicants who have more than one past-secondary credential, getting all the credentials assessed is imperative and advised. In case the Express Entry PNP option opens up, the applicant needs to respond swiftly and have the profile updated, especially the education part.

Moreover, by garnering and completing another level of education can be quite advantageous. There are many cases wherein the applicant is just few certain month or courses from completing the degree, of whose assessment level can be quite impactful and help in enhancing the ranking of the CRS. For other candidates it is recommended to opt for higher qualification of education, completion of which increases the chances and brings the dream of migrating to Canada much closer.

<b>Language</b>

As per its worth of 260 points, language is right up at the top where importances of factors for Canada immigration are considered. Applicants with fluency in both English and French or in either of one have the advantage of garnering maximum points in the Express Entry pool of points. On the other hand, applicants who believe they can show improvement in this language test should opt for more preparation and retake the exam as that can have a positive impact on the CRS ranking. With increasing improvement over any of the language abilities, namely speaking, reading, listening and writing there is equal or more improvement over the CRS score. However, the best and biggest outcome arises when the applicant reaches the primary advance level that is the benchmark 9 for Canadian language factor. This situation ensures that candidate’s chances of getting high level in combination factors and points up to 100 can be achieved along with the points garnered under language category.

Another imperative point to be kept in mind for bilingual applicants is that they should give language test in French and English both. This ensures that the applicants do not lose out on 24 points kept for every language.

<b>Work Factor</b>

Candidates having Canadian work experience garner much more preference; however, the work experience of Non-Canadians is an equally important combination factor. Take the following situation as an example – An applicant ranking quite high with language skills, like CLB at 9 or more, but with a Non-Canadian work experience of just 1-2 years can get up to 25 points. As he or she adds another year to their work profile making the experience to 3, they will be eligible for another 25 points. So this indicates that Non-Canadian applicants need to keep working.

Applicants having garnered Canadian work experience, along with having same rules to follow, have the opportunity to gather higher points due to two imperative elements. One is the Canadian Work Experience in an essence has its own space in points table, which means it does not have to be taken up in combination with other factors. Another element is that points for this can be extended for up to 5 years of work experience. Only consideration that applicants working in Canada at a skilled job are to maintain legal work status throughout.

According to me, another point to keep in mind while applying is to ensure that all additional work performed, irrespective of the fact that it will or not affect the CRS ranking, should also be included in the profile and it should be up to date at all times. This might not favour the ranking today but can definitely reward the applicant with 600 points if he or she becomes eligible for any other PNP category.

<b>Advantages for Couples</b>

The attributes noted above are same for all applicants, irrespective of the fact that they have a better half going with them or not. However, for the candidates who are being accompanied by their better halves have an edge over others as this might help in increasing the CRS score and ranking of the applicant. This happens as the spouse’s education, work experience for Canada and the language skills can get rewarded for 40 points, 20 of which is for language, 10 for Canadian work and rest 10 for education level. If the spouse goes for language test and ECA or for one of them, it might just bring in additional points for the applicant. Furthermore, there are PNPs who offer extra points for the spouse’s education, work experience or language skills.

Another thing to have deep conversation on is to decide who will be considered as principal applicant. There are no rules which can stop either of the partners to become one. For better understanding let’s take an example: Suppose there is a Botany Scientist of 35 years of age and his wife is a 29 years old chef, and they both wish to migrate to Canada. Although the scientist post may seem like a superior and thus a better option for principal applicant, with other details being same, it is the chef who will be able to garner better points as she is younger. Even if you change the job profile of both from botany scientist to Doctor and Chef to clerk but the result will stay the same. Moreover, three years of work experience in the targeted skill is equal to 10 to 15 years because the points accorded maximises at three years of experience. In such situation it is imperative to review whether the spouse can garner better points.

<b>PNPs</b>

Every element discussed above has talked about being in a better position to apply for PNPs of Express Entry for immigration to Canada with every swift improvisation in the applicant’s profile. This is where the candidate can change the whole game as there are 600 points to be gained along with ITA at a following draw and a smooth road directly hitting Permanent Residence opportunity in Canada. To gain this sort of advantage, however, the applicant needs to be even more alert and showcase all the work opportunities and education level as well as keep an ear out for all Canadian migration news. He needs to ensure that all the documents are sorted and reviewed properly in case they need to write in an application swiftly. PNP options generally open and close rapidly, at time in days or just few hours.

Take for an example Express Entry PNP category of Saskatchewan opened just last year, has already opened &amp; closed for about 7 times. Another point is that it changed its acceptable Occupation list recently without any warning for the same. So the applicants who are not prepared for PNP or those who do not keep proper track of their profile along with keeping it updated are at a disadvantaged as opposed to organised and knowledgeable ones.

<b>Myriad Range of Combinations </b>

As already informed earlier, Combination, which in essence means the transferability level of the skills, is one of the most underrated ways of increasing the CRS ranking. At one point or another, applicants are so immersed in one or two areas of immigration process that they overlook the larger picture as whole, which is made of these combination only. Thus it is equally imperative to focus on key combinations in order to gain higher ranking in the score of CRS.

<b>Garnering Job Opportunity through Networking &amp; Visiting Canada</b>

Securing a job opportunity in Canada from another country, although not an impossible task, but is definitely more difficult than ever thought. This situation melts down and become quite achievable once the candidate tries to land interviews via networking and connections he has made. It is a common analogy of Canadian employers to have a meet and greet session with probable candidates for the job in person before selecting the employee. This accords an unfair advantage to candidates settled or present in Canada. Those applicants who are religious to work in Canada should consider visiting Canada for the interviews as these meetings can have long lasting effect on their lives and their dream to work as well as settle in Canada. However, they should prepare for the visit in such a way that they have an advantageous outcome after the interviews. They should connect with job portal to have a ticket to events like Jobs Fair and similar job opportunities.

Visiting Canada for interviews will not only increase the chances of securing a correct and dream job for the applicant, but will also help in growing more options of PNPs as some do accord certain reward points for visiting the country before.

<b>The Final Annotation</b>

If there was only one guidance that I could provide to applicant of Express Entry, it would be – <b>‘Don’t Lose Hope’</b>. The candidates should look for and exhaust all their choices regarding human capital elements, working in Canada along with PNPs as well as myriad range of combinations and move their best foot forward as the end result of this chance will change their lives.

"Cost Borne to Immigrants for Bringing Parents to Australia","6298","Having parents stay with you is a dream come true for every child. The same can be said for the Australia Immigration visa holders. Having the familiar touch of parents nearby in an unknown country is blessing in itself. It is quite possible for Australian immigrants to have their parents with them either permanently or for at least few years by applying for any of the following visas:
<ul>
 	<li>Parent Visa Subclass 103</li>
 	<li>Contributory Parent (Temporary) Visa Subclass 173</li>
 	<li>Contributory Parent Visa Subclass 143</li>
 	<li>Aged Parent visa Subclass 804</li>
 	<li>Contributory Aged Parent (Temporary) Visa Subclass 884</li>
 	<li>Contributory Aged Parent Visa Subclass 864</li>
</ul>
The catch here, however, is that the child will have to act as a sponsor for their parents for certain period of time. The same has been recommended for family reunion visas by Productivity Commission of Australia, who have stated in their report that “Migrants who bring their parents to Australia should be responsible for their living costs as part of an overhaul to family reunion visas.”

This recommendation by the commission will impact and cause certain changes in the community of Australia and addressing the key points of the prepared report, the commission says:
<ul>
 	<li>These changes are bound to bring in some relief over economic pressures.</li>
 	<li>Concerns regarding proper consultation within the community by the Immigrant groups.</li>
 	<li>Those parents’ who’s sponsored child can bear the cost of migrating parents to Australia can stay in the country for much longer period</li>
</ul>
The commission was asked to undertake an investigation citing the consumption of charges for visa and how it will affect the flow of immigration population of Australia.

The report compiled by the Productivity Commission established that there should be certain restrictions put on the commute of parents of immigrants, especially on the older bracket of the age that in turn might reduce the cost incurred by the health and welfare system which otherwise amounts to billions of dollars in the current scenario.

Certain specific recommendations by the commission emphasized on the point that under the temporary visa, parents can be allowed to stay for longer period in the scenario that the sponsor of the visa, as in the child, has the capability to bear the costs of health and welfare of his or her parents.

Another point made by the report is concerning the reason for applying with Non-Contributory Parent Visa. The commission stated that the only reason for allowing this visa should be narrowed down to ‘Compassionate Grounds’ only.

<b>Migration Council of Australia Stated: “More Consultation Needed”</b>

As per the views of Carl Wilshire, Chief Executive – Migration Council Australia, the report is quite balanced and thoroughly researched and thus, she welcomes the recommendations suggested with open arms.

She stated that, “I think it makes some excellent points about recalibrating what some of the economic advantages are of migration.” However the only point of concern she has in regards with changes suggested for immigrant’s parents’ visa process and system. She believes that any changes made in this direction should be taken very carefully and after thorough consultation within the community. She also said

""For a lot of migrant families, separation from parents is a particularly difficult part.""

And thus she believes proper consultation and survey on this change needs to be made before zeroing down to apply the change.

Joseph Caputo, Chairman of Federation of Ethnic Communities Councils of Australia, on reading the report, disagreed with the suggested change in migrant parent visa and stated that the principal governing this visa already follows very strict rules which makes being more stringent unnecessary. He said that it is very disappointing to know that the commission is recommending in making the regulations even more strict and tight for those migrants who wish to bring their parents to Australia.

Pointing out benefits of having parents nearby, he said that the grandparents make perfect babysitters for those immigrants who work hard not only for themselves but also for Australian community. They provide best childcare possible for their grandchildren.

He also gave another advantage of having parents in Australia by stating “""They can also contribute in other ways, including helping the family settle in Australia without the worry of an elderly parent alone overseas.""

<b>New arrivals do not have any impact whatsoever on Local Jobs, Commission Report says</b>

The report comprised by the Productivity Commission also sheds light on the impact of migration on the labor market of Australia. It clearly states that local worker and labors have not faced any kind of brunt, neither positive nor negative, from immigrants for the period of 2000-2011. The influence on the young labor market is negligible. Furthermore, the report also came to the conclusion that the employers are less likely to offer training on the job due to easy accessibility of trained and experienced migrating labor through Temporary Skilled Work Visa Subclass 457.

Another point noted is the pressure on land and upward swing of housing prices in the largest cities of Australia due to increasing immigration to Australia.

The Productivity Commission stated ""Upward pressures are exacerbated by the persistent failure of successive state, territory and local governments to implement sound urban planning and zoning policies.”

Peter Dutton, Spokesperson for Immigration Minister responded by saying that the Federal Government has received the report comprised and will provide their response for the same recommendation in due course.",,"2016-09-23 10:01:47","cost-borne-to-immigrants-for-bringing-parents-to-australia","1","publish","https://www.immigrationxperts.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/images.jpg",,,"1","open","0","off","off","30","#000","0","off","0","58",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Blog|Australia",

"Australia Migration: Proposal for Major Reforms","6450","Major reforms have been proposed for Australia Migration to the benefit of skilled and young applicants. These changes have been proposed in order to infuse Australia’s population with more skilled individuals. The changes have been proposed by the Productivity Commission that created the ‘Migrant Intake Into Australia’ report in order to analyze the current migration process.

There report encompassed both the factors in Australia and foreign countries from where people are migrating to Australia. Currently the factors are measured quantitatively on the basis of parameters such as:
<ul>
 	<li>Age</li>
 	<li>Health</li>
 	<li>Skill Proficiency</li>
 	<li>Language Proficiency</li>
 	<li>Educational Qualification</li>
</ul>
<strong>Net Worth
</strong>
The candidates were also required to submit a character certificate such as a police check certificate. The police check certificate also verified the eligibility for security check.

<strong>The new factors have proposed so that:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Income and living standard of Australian citizens improves</li>
 	<li>Budget of Australian government improves</li>
 	<li>Entry charges</li>
 	<li>Tax to be received in future</li>
 	<li>Government spending in future</li>
 	<li>Australia meets its international obligations</li>
 	<li>The benefits and costs of both permanent and temporary migration have been weighed before making the final proposals</li>
</ul>
<strong>Occupation</strong>

The new factors give more focus to occupation. This is done in order to make sure that occupations with job opening are tied up with skilled individuals for maximum benefit. The skill requirements are to set solely on the basis of the occupation through which the applicant has applied. This will make sure that each individual is judged according to the skilled required for a particular occupation.

Also, all the migration programs related to skilled workers must be brought under the umbrella of one points based system to make the whole process easier.

<strong>Age
</strong>
The age limit is to be considerably reduced from 50 years in order to facilitate the migration of younger applicants. The age limit is to be reduced in most of the migration programs especially the skilled ones. Still, they are in a pickle as they want people with high proficiency in their skills to be able to migrate easily to Australia. This is why a proposal for certain exceptions to the age limit have been made.

<strong>No of applicants
</strong>
Applicants without any dependent family members will be given preference. A lot of cost is involved in the process of migration and even more for the dependents. Australia wants to cut this cost by providing benefit or more points to single applicants without dependents Furthermore, the primary applicant will be awarded more points than the dependants in the immigration process. Also, the primary applicant should be given more points on the basis of skills and traits of the secondary applicant.

<strong>Assessment of Dependants
</strong>
To up the ante, it has been recommended that the adult partners and children of the primary applicant should be assessed to maximize the benefit to Australia. All factors such as skills, age, and education and so on need to be taken into consideration.",,"2016-10-12 11:55:33","australia-migration-proposal-for-major-reforms","1","publish","https://www.immigrationxperts.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/immigration-australia-6.jpg",,,"1","open","0","off","off","30","#000","0","off","0","70",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Immigration News|Australia",

"Australia: A healthy Economy for Immigrants","6469","Australia, the sixth largest country in the world, is said to be one of the strongest and stablest economies. Australia has a mixed economy, i.e., an economy that supports both free market and state enterprise.

<strong>Australia’s Economy</strong>

The World Bank has provided the following details about the economy of Australia:
<ul>
 	<li>Gross Domestic Product (2015): 1.62 trillion USD</li>
 	<li>GDP per capita: 64,500 USD</li>
 	<li>Inflation (CPI): 1.0%
The 2011 Credit Suisse Global Wealth Report showed that Australia has a median wealth of 222,000 US dollars while US has a median wealth of 50,000 US dollars. This means that the average person in Australia is earning more than four times of what a person earns on average in the US. The same report also mentioned that Australia’s wealth has quadrupled over the past decade.</li>
</ul>

The above figures are enough to substantiate the point of Australia’s stable economy. The mining and service sector contribute the most to the Australia’s Economy. That being said, let us further analyze as to why Australia’s economy is still stable and will be so in the long run as well

<strong>Mining Industry</strong>

The mining industry is by far one of the greatest contributors to Australia’s economy. It has for a long time corroborated and helped to maintain a stable environment in Australian markets. The British were the first to realize the strength of Australia’s mining industry and initiated the infrastructure projects to support the mining industry.

<strong>Quality of Life</strong>

Australia was ranked 6th in the Worldwide quality of life index, 2005 published by The Economist. The quality of life index is widely accepted as the true indicator of the average person's’ life in a country. This index takes into account multiple factors such as GDP per capita, life expectancy, divorce rate, unemployment rate, climate and so on. All of these factors combined together can serve as the real indicator of the welfare of people of a Country.

<strong>Export</strong>

Australia is one of the few developed countries with a booming export sector. Australia is endowed with a huge amount of natural resources with majority of the land uninhabited. The agriculture sector contributes a lot towards exports. Australia is known to market widely to countries like China, US and Japan. The products exported can range from gold and iron to wheat and live animals. Australia also exports crude petroleum, coal and natural gas.

<strong>Tax</strong>

Taxation in Australia is transparent and lucid to understand. Other than income tax, excise duty and so on, Australia also uses the Goods and Service Tax that is a conglomeration of most of the indirect taxes on commodities and services. The GST is collected at the point of sale and subsides the overall complications related in the Manufacturing process. GST also brings down the cost of products for consumers and augments the revenue for organisations.

Ontario definitely has won over the heart of Immigrants. According to the research published by MoneySense, Burlington is the best place for Immigrants. The average household income in Burlington is CAD 110,031 which is below some other cities but this town definitely makes it up for it with the other factors.

Most days in Burlington are above 0oC while the crime rate is way below the other towns in Canada. 22.33% of the population is constituted of immigrants. Following Burlington is yet another town of Ontario, Vaughan. Though the average rent for an 1 bedroom is substantially more than that in Burlington, still it makes for a great place to live in for the affluent immigrants.

The fourth position is held by Richmond and guess in which province does it fall. You definitely must have guessed it right.

"300,000 Immigrants to be allowed entry into Canada in 2017","6482","Let the festivities begin”, says Canada for immigrants and their families. On the basis of the report published by Immigration, Refugee and Citizenship Canada, John Mccallum has come to the conclusion of considerably increasing the base number of immigrants into Canada. 300,000 more immigrants will be provided with a Canada PR in the coming year.

Skilled Immigration will witness a hike in the total number of immigrants taken through the program. Skilled Immigration has been Canada's one stop source for talented individuals. Augmenting skilled workers will definitely behoove Canada and its citizens. Not only skilled workers but their families will also be able to avail most amount of benefit from the recent announcements.

Candidates can apply through:
<ul>
 	<li>Express entry program</li>
 	<li>Povincial Nominee Program</li>
 	<li>Family migration</li>
 	<li>Business Migration</li>

Maintaining the high level of refugee influx had held Canada back from substantially augmenting the number of immigrants. Immigration, in the opinion of Rachel Blaney, is good for Canada’s economy and the government should be taking more ambitious steps towards this. There are high hopes that the base number will be further increased in the coming years as John Mccallum was noted saying, “We do it well, but I think we could learn to do it better.”",,"2016-11-01 05:32:12","300000-immigrants-to-be-allowed-entry-into-canada-in-2017","1","publish","https://www.immigrationxperts.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/immigration-au-canada.jpg",,,"1","open","0","off","off","30","#000","0","off","0","68",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Immigration News|Canada",
"PNP is the Best known Secret for Canada PR","6487","Skilled workers opting to work in Canada often go for Permanent Residency in Canada rather than just work on temporary basis. The reasons for this are quite obvious as the country not only beautiful life and career opportunity to immigrants. The immigration policy for Canada is also quite compliant as the immigration process is much more clear and concise. The point of discretion, however, is getting through the point based express entry program that is not quite easy for many.

In this scenario, the only alternative left with the applicant is to look for another way of getting PR for Canada. The best option to get near that permanent residency is through Provincial Nominee Program.

Under PNP, applicant can get immigration access to Canada in a quite simple and easy manner by garnering nomination from a territory or province of Canada. Once the applicant receives the nomination from any province of Canada for the visa under PR, it is almost a guarantee and stamp of getting Permanent residency in Canada.

Some key points that the applicant needs to be aware of under PNP for Canada Immigration and PR visa for the same are:
<ul>
 	<li>Every single province or territory of Canada has its own program for Provincial Nomination under which a set</li>
 	<li>number of candidates are invited and nominated to apply for PR.</li>
 	<li>Prospective candidates are chosen on the basis of requirement and needs arising for the set skills in that</li>
 	<li>particular province’s labor market and economy which are present with candidate.</li>
 	<li>The province then nominates the prospective applicant towards Immigration Refugee and Citizenship Canada</li>
 	<li>(IRCC) for PR.</li>
 	<li>The moment the candidate receives the nomination, they have around 60 days to apply for PR with IRCC from</li>
 	<li>the date of receipt of invitation and nomination.</li>
</ul>
PNPs Express Entry Stream:

PNPs also have segregated Express Entry Stream that is applicable for only that province but works hand in hand with the Express Entry System to select that perfect group of candidates for Canada Immigration and PR. Under this stream, the prospective candidates structure a profile for themselves in the Express Entry System showcasing their interest to migrate to a particular province/territory or all the states and territories of Canada. Next step is to get selected in the pool of candidates under Express Entry System.

All the provinces of Canada have full access to the pool of candidates under express entry. Once they viewed all the selected candidates in the Express Entry system, they pick and choose those applicants which fit perfectly with the requirement list for their province and subsequently send an invitation to apply for PR with their respective province. On receiving the nomination to apply, candidate needs to apply within set period of days after which they get Provincial Nomination Certificate if they are selected. This certificate automatically awards 600 points to the total points of the candidate under Express Entry System which sure shot paves the way for getting ITA for Canada PR visa.

In case you wish to apply for Canada Immigration and subsequent PR visa through PNP then the best way is to approach an Immigration consultancy that have proficient agents to guide you through the whole process and ensure that you get maximum advantage while applying for the best province suitable as per your skills and qualification.

One such Immigration agency is Immigration Xperts that have authenticity and reliability for providing best immigration services for Canada in the market.

"Serious Changes proposed for Australia Migration","6490","A substantial change has been proposed for immigration eligibility criteria in Australia. Productivity commission has proposed the recent changes that will be good news for some and a bad news for the others.

<strong>Reduce age limit and give students extra points</strong>

This is in response to the aging population in Australia. Australia is one of the most celebrated countries in regards to immigration. This makes it Important for them to cherry pick the individuals who can contribute the most towards the economy of Australia. The upper limit of age has been recommended to be brought down from 50 years. In addendum to this, students are to be assigned more points

<strong>Make SOL (Skilled Occupation List) a Benchmark</strong>

Occupation list create a muddling effect for immigrants and Australian authorities. This is due to the availability of multiple occupation lists differing from state to state. To remove any discrepancies, it has been suggested that the SOL should be used as a standard list.

<strong>Marks allocated to applicants</strong>

Primary applicants without dependent family members or partners will be allocated maximum points. In addition to this, primary applicants can now gain more points on the basis of their secondary skills. Additional points are to be allocated to skilled immigrants who have been nominated by an Australia based employer.

<strong>Criteria for partner and children</strong>

In the eyes of the commission, partners and children of the primary applicants should be assessed on the basis of following criteria:
<ul>
 	<li>Age</li>
 	<li>Educational Qualification</li>
 	<li>Skills</li>

"Government plans to raise maximum age of children on immigration applications to 21","6508","Surprising but appreciated move of Canada Government – Raise Maximum Limit of Children to 21 on Immigration Applications

A move that is highly anticipated and appreciated by the Canadian and permanent citizens along with prospective candidates for Canada PR as the Canada Government has announced its decision to raise the bar on minimum age of dependent children to 21 years that are to be mentioned in the immigration application.

Once this decision gains approval from proper authorities it should be effective from 2017 fall and would be applicable for prospective applicants who have applied either on or after this change has been substantiated in the rules and regulations.

At present the children of prospective principal candidate can only be added in immigration application on dependent basis if their age is 19 or below for Canadian permanent residence or to be counted eligible for principal candidate for sponsorship under category of family class immigration. Under prior government rules, dependent children maximum age allowed was lowered on 1st August 2014 and prior to that was done between 28th June 2002 and 31st July 2014 wherein the maximum age allowed for dependent children in immigration was less than 22. This change basically goes back to previous age allowed before the change on 1st August 2014. As per the survey done it is found out that between 2002 and 2014 up to 11% of dependent children were either 19 years old or above that.

Commitment Towards Family Reunification

Current Government in Ottawa, the Liberal Party, has committed themselves towards reunion of families and has thus based their immigration policies on this reunification which can be possible due to this change of increasing the maximum age as then more and more families can reside together while hoping and garnering permanent residence status of Canada.

The IRCC (Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada) keeping this change in policy has stated that it will offer opportunity of Permanent Resident status to those:

<strong>“young adults [who] would be unlikely to be eligible for permanent resident status as principal applicants under an economic immigration program, until they have completed post-secondary education and gained significant work experience.”</strong>

Subsequently this change will not only result in reunion of many immigrant families who can now live together and thus will also be able link up the society that much faster, but it also offers the choice of having a successful life in Canada through various education and job opportunity which they would not have been able to avail for earlier. IRCC in their statement also emphasized on Education as one of the important factor for this change in age.

They said that

<strong>“Given the importance placed on education, it is not unusual for some children to remain with their nuclear family while pursuing higher education before entering the labor market . . . The proposed increase of the maximum age of dependent children is consistent with the underlying socioeconomic trend that children remain at home longer with their parents, particularly those studying for lengthier periods,”</strong>

Another statement that pressed on the favorability of this change in accordance with education factor was -

“Notably, the proposed higher age limit would enable many postsecondary students — who complete a degree at a median age of 24.8 years of age — to be eligible as dependent children through much of their undergraduate studies.”
John McCallum, Immigration minister of Canada, has been an avid advocator of post-secondary education of International students in Canada and has always voiced his opinion in their favor. His support to this change is because it will give an opportunity to students of other nationalities to complete their education in prestigious education institutions of Canada which would not be possible in current scenario.

Right Step at Right Time and Direction

In words of David Cohen, an Attorney, the fact that IRCC is planning to their current policy on age back to the one they had before is perfectly timed and goes in the correct direct for betterment of all – Canada as well as the immigrants.

He stated that -

“The rationale behind the decision to increase the maximum age reflects the reality of so many families today who want their children to obtain the best education possible. Realistically, this often means that children remain dependent on their parents for longer — but the reward is significant. With this change, not only will families be able to stay together, but more young people will be able to benefit from the fantastic opportunities Canada can offer to students and young professionals. Likewise, Canada is sure to benefit from an increase in talented young people at the beginning of their careers — these ‘best and brightest’ that Minister McCallum is so keen to attract.”

This decision of Canada Government and IRCC is much welcomed by many immigration agencies as well.

You can very well travel to the country and live your happily ever after. However, laws do not bend even for star crossed lovers. You will have to apply for a visa, especially Partner Visa, if you wish to stay with your partner on a Permanent basis.

Partner Migration Visa is often opted for when family migration visas are talked about. It basically allows the partner or would be partner of an Australian or a citizen of Australia to migrate to the country with Permanent Residence status. However, the problem comes when due some reason or other the visa application gets rejected. To ensure that it does not happen with you we have compiled here some useful tips as we all know that rules and regulation under Australia Visa is far more complex in reality as it is on paper. The tips are:
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Filing for the visa before you get married:</strong> The best way to avoid any problem is to file for the Partner visa after you get married as then you have solid proof of your spousal relation which is required to qualify under this visa. One exception is filing for it while being in a Defacto relationship. However, in case the couple does not qualify under both situations then what? Well the simple answer is to for alternatives like Prospective Spouse Visa Subclass 300 wherein the applicant couple states that they will get married in Australia and are already booked with a celebrant. The visa is for 9 months and the couple are expected to get married within those 9 months and then successfully apply for Partner visa.</li>
 	<li><strong>Determining the Defacto Relation:</strong> This is one of the easiest way to gain Partner Visa. Well that’s what people think at least. Technically under this scenario the couple propagate that they are in Defacto relation which means they are living together for last 12 months or more. However, it is not that easy as there are certain criteria that need to be fulfilled in order for visa officer to trust in this fact. These criteria are:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
 	<li><strong>Cohabitating:</strong> Under this the couple has to showcase that either they are living together under one roof or are not apart on permanent basis. This can be proved via joint lease, owning of property together or according corresponding address which is in name of both the partners.</li>
 	<li><strong>Combined Finances:</strong> One of the best way to prove your Defacto relation is by giving sufficient proof that all the finances are shared by both. This can be done showing pooling of finances in one places from both sides like having a joint bank account or equal ownership of assets, wills etc.</li>
 	<li><strong>Proof of Co-dependency in Society:</strong> The applicant needs to prove that both the partners are considered as couple in their society. This can be done by showing family gathering pictures, photographs with each other’s relatives and friends.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Restrictions under Repeat Sponsorship:</strong> This tip applies to those applicants who have either applied for Partner visa before or are themselves sponsored under Partner visa. Certain restrictions under different scenarios of this point that you need to be aware about are:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
 	<li><strong>Have Applied for Sponsoring a Partner Before:</strong> In this case you need to have a gap of at least 5 years between the two sponsorship. Furthermore, only two times you can sponsor a partner in your whole life.<strong>Have </strong></li>
 	<li><strong>Been the Sponsored Partner Before:</strong> In such scenario the partner sponsoring, as in the you, need to wait for at least 5 years before getting the opportunity to sponsor the partner yourself.</li>
 	<li><strong>Have Been the Sponsored Partner under Contributory Partner Visa</strong>: In this case as well you will have to wait for 5 years before being allowed to sponsor a partner yourself.</li>
</ol>
These tips will not get you Partner Visa early but will definitelyhelp you to avoid certain mistakes which can be a big setback in garnering the visa on time. One another advice is to approach an immigration agency to apply for your visa as they reduce your tension down to 30 – 40 % straight away as all the formalities and paperwork becomes their responsibility.

"Australia Rated the Best Place for Immigrants","6514","Australia, the island country has been acclaimed to be one of the best nations for immigration to live in. With a strong economy that is still budding, Australia sure provides some of the best opportunities for immigrants and tourists alike. According to The World Bank, Australia has a very strong economy. <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">The following details corroborate their point</span>:
<ul>

 	<li>GDP per capita: 64,500 USD</li>
 	<li>Inflation (CPI): 1.0%</li>
</ul>
The median salary in Australia is more than 4 times than that of US. On the basis of median, every person in Australia earns 222,000 US dollars while a person in US earns 50,000 US dollars. Moreover, Australia's wealth has quadrupled over the past decade. All of this information can be found in the 2011 Credit Suisse Global Wealth Report. Australia is also one of the only developed countries that are witnessing a boom in Export. Trade with countries like China, Japan and India has kept Australia’s Export to a record high number. Gold, iron, wheat, live animals, petroleum, coal and natural gas are some products that Australia Manufactures

Tax is something that most of us are worried about. Fortunately Australia has a GST (Goods and Service Tax) system that amalgamates all other taxes along the manufacturing route of a product and imposes it on the final product. This system aids in subsiding all complications as well as substantially bringing down the cost of products. Holding one of the top positions in Worldwide quality of life index, 2005, Australia is in fact one of the best places to live in. The quality of life takes into consideration the <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">following parameters:</span>

Australia’s mining industry has always been the backbone of its economy. Australia has depended on it since the time it was founded by the Britishers. It is the mining industry that was responsible for building of infrastructure by the Britishers in the country. This was done in order to get the most out of the mining powerhouse of Australia. Australia is also one of the best countries to travel in. Hardly witnessing any cataclysm, Australia also is one of the most secure places to visit on earth. Most major towns in Australia are located near the coast. This makes beach access easier for Australian residents and citizens.

"4 ways Non Residential Indians (NRIs) can change their 500 and 1000 rupee notes","6527","In a totally surprising move yesterday, Indian Prime Minister addressed the Indian nation and declared that use of 500 and 1000 INR notes from 9 November 2016, 12:00 am onwards will be illegal as both the notes are being scraped from the Indian economy. This step by the Indian Government is said to be the boldest and most secretive move in the whole history of India and probably its future.

In his words he stated –” ""Brothers and sisters, to rid this country of the termite-like corruption and black money, it has become essential to take one more tough step. Starting midnight tonight, that is, on the midnight of November 8, 2016, the current currency notes of denominations of rupees 500 and rupees 1,000, will no longer remain legal tender. These currencies will become legally invalid.""

This came as a shock not only for the Indian nation but also for the Indian community living outside India. NRIs in Australia and all over the world find themselves in a fix as to what they should do with the Indian currency notes of 500 and 1000 that they have with themselves. The answer to this is four small option they can opt for:
<ol>
 	<li>Carry the currency notes with you to India in order to get it converted.</li>
 	<li>Access money changing facility of your city to convert the cash to current country’s currency.</li>
 	<li>As per RBI’s guidelines NRIs can put in their cash in their NRO savings account.</li>
 	<li>For those who have cash left in India, they can authorize another close relation to deposit the cash in the bank.</li>
 	<li>They will need to provide the authority letter as proof along with a valid ID card.</li>

"Garnering Access to Ottawa PR will be much easier than before","6564","Canadian government recently has introduced many changes in its immigration policy that has actually changed the whole system around. Previously it brought in changes related to CRS with immediate effect from 19th November 2016, under which the applicants who were garnering 600 points through LMIA (Labor Market Impact Assessment) will not only be awarded 200 for senior managerial positions and 50 for rest of the job offers. These changes were much appreciated as it opened gates for not only foreign skilled workers and international students to gain PR easily but also helps the companies established in Canada to gain required professionals easily.

The view point of Immigration Minister John McCallum on these changes and why they are being implemented is - “We have committed to doing more to attract highly skilled immigrants to come to Canada and become permanent residents, because this is important to build our economy and strengthen our society.”

As per Wattpad CEO Allen Lau, these changes will lessen the difference seen in the demand and supply of skilled workers required in Canadian economy where the demand was quite high and supply was not able to catch up in time.

"Latest Update on Express Entry Draw for Canada Immigration","6570","30th November 2016 brought in exciting news for some while being a letdown for other Canada immigration aspirants. As per the latest express entry draw which came out on 30th, 559 applicants, under PNP list, received ITA having at least 786 CRS (Comprehensive Ranking System) points. This is the first list that has come up after the significant changes in Canada immigration were executed on 19th November 2016 and has set record in the first go itself as 786 is the highest CRS score needed since the day Express Entry system was started in 2015 January.

This score is quite far off from the previous 470 CRS score that was needed in the last express entry draw on 16th November 2016. This difference is due to additional 600 points garnered by applicants under PNP for job offer. As the invites were only offered to the group of PNP there has been a significant inflation in the point’s requirement.

This is 25th express entry draw of 2016 and 48th since this system started in January 2015. Right now invites have been sent to 559 lucky candidates.

"No visa required for OCI card holders when returning to India","6573","<strong>Good News for Indians Living Outside!!</strong>

As per the new law mentioned in The Hindu, Indians living outside of the country and having OCI (Overseas Citizens of India) card do not have to get visa issued while returning to the country. Although carrying passport is mandatory, having visa stamped on it to enter India will not be required. Indian Government has recently made a decision to get rid of the entire process once the OCI and PIO (Persons of Indian Origin) were combined in the year 2015.

Earlier, even those with OCI or PIO had to get a visa affixed when they planned to travel back to India. This, however, will not be the case now, as in the words of Indian Government’s senior official - people with OCI card will not be needed to apply for visa when planning to visit India.

As per the website of VFS Global, that manages functionality of Visa, OCI, Passport and other respective services, stated - “It has been decided by the Government of India to dispense with the requirement of producing foreign passport containing the 'U' Visa sticker in the case of OCI Cardholders while they enter/exit India.”

As from 2015 PIO card have been discontinued and merged with OCI for which card holders were given time of a year to switch to OCI which has been further extended to 30th June",,"2016-12-05 11:21:54","no-visa-required-for-oci-card-holders-when-returning-to-india","1","publish","https://www.immigrationxperts.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/INDIA_jpg_2523604f.jpg",,,"1","open","0","off","off","30","#000","0","off","0","103",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Immigration News|India",
"National Minimum Wages across the World","6580","National minimum wages of employees all over the world vary from country to country. Some of them accord higher wages than other countries. There are certain countries which have tighter rules regarding the minimum wage which in turn ensures higher average of employees’ wage while some countries have strong worker unions. These two reasons are probably why some countries have high average for minimum wages while some countries don’t.

Keeping the survey done by OECD (Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development) a table has been drawn for top 10 national minimum wages in the world. The data has comprised in terms of hourly wages of each country from the year 2013 and the currency mentioned is of US dollars, converted from other currencies of the countries by using the OECD’s calculation method of Purchasing Power Parity.

The table does not include countries like Denmark, Finland, Austria, Italy, Iceland, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland as the countries do not follow the federal policy for calculating minimum wages.

"Improvisations Recommended for Canadian Temporary Foreign Worker Program","6583","Canada immigration is one of most opted immigration in the world. People all across the globe want to try their hand in getting employment opportunities to work and stay in Canada mostly because of its mixed culture and impeccable work atmosphere. Keeping this enthusiasm of foreign workers in mind, Minister of IRCC (Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada), Honourable John McCallum combined forces with Honourable MaryAnn Mihychuk, Minister of Employment, Development Workforce and labour, to improve and bring out measures that will improve the immigration situation for Temporary Foreign Worker program. Some of these rules have already been implemented while some other is Work in Progress. Giving their views on the same both the ministers stated following:

<strong>In words of Honourable John McCallum –</strong>

""In many ways, the four-year rule causes a lot of uncertainty and instability among employers as among temporary workers. We felt it represented an excessive burden for applicants and employers, as well as for agents who handle requests. The hearings of the Standing Committee on Human Resources, Skills Development, Social Development and the Status of Disabled Persons have been confirmed. We believe that this important recommendation from the Committee requiring rapid intervention, and we are following today.”

<strong>While Honourable MaryAnn Mihychuk stated the following –</strong>

“Our government is committed to the Temporary Foreign Worker Program is useful for our economy. Thus, we ensure that employment opportunities are first available to Canadians, including groups traditionally underrepresented in the labor market, such as Aboriginal. """,,"2016-12-15 07:12:38","improvisations-recommended-for-canadian-temporary-foreign-worker-program","1","publish","https://www.immigrationxperts.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/MCCALLUM.jpg",,,"1","open","0","off","off","30","#000","0","off","0","45",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Immigration News|Canada",
"Demonetization a trend and Australia may soon follow it","6586","Demonetization of high value currency notes in India has set a new Vogue. Impressed with measures, to curb corruption and curtail the shadow economy, taken by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Federal Government of Australia has set up an enquiry into the use of $100 notes and how these notes abet people in using black money.

On November 8, 2016 Prime Minister Modi announced the discontinuation of Rs500 and Rs 1000 notes. The covert operation on black money will help India in minimizing its shadow economy while promoting people to go for digital transactions. “The whole point of this crackdown on the black economy is to make sure we close down any potential loopholes” said Revenue and Financial Services Minister Kelly O’Dwyer.

She had also mentioned in her interview with ABC radio that there are 3 times more $100 notes in circulation as compared to $5 notes. A war on illegal cash transactions will have a Domino effect on the shadow economy of Australia which accounts for 1.5 percent of Australia’s GDP.

She also opinionated, “There's nothing wrong with cash per se, the issue is when people don't declare it and when they don't pay tax on it.” She seems content with her step and said that she will not obstruct the taskforce looking into this matter and would not influence their decision in any way.",,"2016-12-15 07:20:12","demonetization-a-trend-and-australia-may-soon-follow-it","1","publish","https://www.immigrationxperts.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/australia-plans-to-demonetise-100-bank-note980-1481702498_980x457.jpg",,,"1","open","0","off","off","30","#000","0","off","0","119",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Immigration News|Australia",

"Visitor Visa for Parents","6622","When it comes to migration for parents to Australia, the popular choices include:
<ul>
 	<li>Aged Parent Visa (Subclass 804)</li>
 	<li>Contributory Aged Parent Visa (Subclass 864)</li>
 	<li>Contributory Parent Visa (Subclass 143)</li>
 	<li>Parent Visa (Subclass 103)</li>
</ul>
It becomes imminent to select the right category to apply thorough. Thorough research is required in order to determine the best route after weighing the cost and benefit. Aged Parent Visa and Parent Visa are popular options among applicants who have time on their hands. It can take up to 30 years for immigration department to approve the applicant for Australian permanent residency.

Another popular choice is the contributory aged parent visa and Contributory Parent Visa. Both of these have an upper limit of 2 years of processing period. Still there is a catch as the approximate cost of gaining a PR though these two categories is $45,000. The cost of this visa is enough to daunt many applicants from applying through these routes.

<strong>Visitor Visa: A popular Alternative</strong>

There is something else that applicants can try. Applicants can apply for a visitor visa for their parents. The time taken to process a visitor visa is negligible in comparison to all the other options. Parents of Australian Citizens and Permanent Residents can enjoy the perk of extended validity on visitor visa.

How to apply for a Visitor Visa for Parents

<strong>Electronic Travel Authority (eTA)</strong>

An eTA/eVisitor visa can be applied for by the applicant. The perks of applying through this route would be the seamlessness of processing time and also the inexpensiveness of this visa. The application for an eTA can be filled online and is process under 24 hours unless some discrepancy in the information provided is found. Only citizens of certain countries such as United States, United Kingdom and so on are eligible for applying for an eTA. Nevertheless, an eTA would be perfect if a short stay is expected from the parents.
An eTA will cost you between AUD 135 to AUD 1000. Additional charges may be applicable.

<strong>Parent Visa</strong>

This visa can work in addendum with travel visa. It can take a lot of time and money in gaining an Australian PR through parent visa. The atrocities inflicted by time can be abated in the meantime with a visitor visa. Applicants whose application is in the queue for visitor visa are entitled to an extension that takes up the validity of visitor visa to 5 years.

<strong>Australian Permanent Residents and Citizens</strong>

There are many perks of being an Australian Permanent Resident of Citizen. Medicare and social welfare programs of Australia are acclaimed throughout the globe. A lesser known perk that only a few citizens and permanent residents are aware of is the fact that their parents can get an extension on their visitor visa. Though the period of extension differ on various factors.

A visitor visa is perfect for a short stay in Australia. Considering the cost and time taken to process the application, it can be used in addition to the Parent Visa. Parents would be required to leave Australia every 12 months till the time their visitor visa is valid.

"How to Find Job in Australia from India?","6644","Indian diaspora is the largest in the world with more than 1.5 million Indians living outside their country while seeking better opportunities to sustain the life of their dream. The void left by the lack of jobs in Indian economy meets the lack of manpower and skilled individuals of developed countries such as Australia.

Here are some facts to corroborate my point:
<ul>
 	<li>23 million population</li>
 	<li>GDP: 1.56 trillion USD</li>
 	<li>GDP per capita: 42,450 USD</li>
</ul>
The standard of living in developed countries like Australia is much better than that of India. Job prospects fairly augment as one moves from highly competitive economies such as India. All major Australian cities are located near the coast making beach access easier for Australian residents. Fairly large number of tourists attractions such as Sydney Opera House, Great Barrier Reef, Alice Spring, Melbourne and so on.

Australia is a major developed economy which is facing a lack of manpower and skilled individuals in multiple industries such as IT. This makes Australia a popular choice to migrate for Indians. There are myriad visa categories that enable people to find employment in Australia.

<strong>Visas that enables people to work in Australia:</strong>

<strong>Skilled Migration Visas</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Skilled Independent Visa (Subclass 189)</li>
 	<li>Skilled Nominated Visa (subclass 190)</li>
 	<li>Skilled Regional (Provisional) Visa (subclass 489)</li>
</ul>
<strong>Temporary work visas</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Temporary work (Skilled) Visa (Subclass 457)</li>
 	<li>Employer Nomination Scheme Visa (Subclass 189)</li>
 	<li>Regional Sponsored Migration Scheme Visa (Subclass 187)</li>
</ul>
There are more categories such as holiday work visa, Employer nomination visa and so on. It becomes imminent to be conversant with these visa categories and to spot the one which offers paramount compatibility. There are many immigration consultancies that can help you in finding the visa category that is most likely going to work for you.

Okay, so after taking the aim at the right visa category one must move ahead and prepare their documents as well as resume. People who are nominated by an employer are most likely to get their application for work permit in approved. This would require extensive research on your part. The first thing that you must do is look at the different occupation lists provided by Australian authorities. Australian Capital Territory Occupation List and Skilled Occupation Lists are the two primary lists that every candidate must go through.

While looking through occupations in these lists, it is important for you to jot down all the occupations that your credentials are in agreement with. At this point you can browse through jobs on Australian job portals. This handy tip will enable you to check the required skills for the job as well as the salary that you can expect. You can also go through Consolidated Sponsored Occupation List of different states and cities of Australia. This will help you to zero in on your job prospects in Australia.

By now you must be familiar with the job environment in Australia. Australia is ranked among the top 10 in quality of life index. You must also know the difference in the perks offered alongside skilled migration and temporary work visa. Essentially, applications for temporary work visa are processed at lightning fast speed, and i exaggerate for a point. Skilled migration or business migration costs both money and time. Though the perks associated with it are immense such as:
<ul>
 	<li>Work indefinitely in Australia</li>
 	<li>Avail medicare and social welfare programs after first few years of migration</li>
 	<li>Study in Australia</li>
</ul>
Application for work permit will be approved after determining your eligibility. Eligibility is ascertained through multiple criterias such as:
<ul>
 	<li>Age</li>
 	<li>Work experience</li>
 	<li>Occupation</li>
 	<li>Skill proficiency</li>
 	<li>Language proficiency</li>
 	<li>Education</li>
</ul>
In addendum to this, you are required to present a medical certificate and a character certificate. A medical certificate from a registered medical specialist can be presented to the immigration authorities. A police check certificate can be used as a character certificate. You must get this from every nation in which you have stayed for at least a year. All countries in which you have put up in 10 years prior to applying for a visa through which you are seeking a work permit.

Language Proficiency is checked with the help of language ability tests like IELTS (International English Language Testing System) and TOEFL (Test of English as a Foreign Language). Clearing one of these exams will enable you to apply for work permit through Australian visa. The higher you score on these tests the better your marks will be in the language proficiency section. The best way to prepare for these exams is to take classes. You can use flashcards and organise your day with the help of tools like Google calendar.

"Ahmed Hussen – Journey from Teen Refugee to IRC Minister","6675","Keeping in tune with the appreciation and excitement of the voters, Prime Minister Justine Trudeau announced the inclusion of new member – Ahmed Hussen, into the minister family of Immigration, Refugee and Citizenship as the liberal MP of Ontario. He has already started waves of newness within the parliament house by being the 1st Somali heritage member. His authenticity and pledge to be more than just being limited to his community has already won hearts of many.

Keeping certain ideas in mind of being just a mainstream guy as well as heeding the advice of his mother to not to forget who you are, Minister Ahmed Hussen commented – “Everyone has a heritage, but we have a shared citizenship, right?""

In the words of a huge supporter – Ahmed Abdi, of the honorable minister Ahmed Hussen, “For Somali youth, it will be a new day. Maybe our youth [will] follow him and have hoped they can be something in Canada.”

The question remains to be seen is whether the piling expectation of the whole Somali community on the minister have any effect on him. But it seems like, just like all of us, even the liberal minister of Ontario turns to his mother for advice who when contacted just guided him to ‘never forget who you are and where you have come from’. Pretty sound advice if you ask us.

Hussen mentioned the pride he feels on being the citizen of a country that opens its borders for immigrants and refugees in need.

So I will bring those experiences to the table as I take on this new challenge in my life.""

<strong>This could be a benediction for immigrants as the policies for immigration may be relaxed further.</strong>

Trudeau’s Stance

Trudeau’s stance has always been in line with the stance, of ‘Liberal Party of Canada’ on Immigration. From time immemorial, the LPC has corroborated the infusion of multiple cultures in the Canadian Population.

“Immigration is critical to job creation and long term economic growth for the middle class. In so many ways, Canada is what it is today thanks to the entrepreneurial spirit of those who chose to build their lives here.” Said Justin Trudeau as reported by Liberal.

His party, with John MaCcallum on the front of immigration, has drastically changed the immigration landscape. Express entry has been a huge success and the fact is supported by numbers. The report published by Immigration, Refugee and Citizenship Canada contained the following facts:
<ul>
 	<li>No of Invitation to Apply (ITA) issued to Skilled Workers: 30,000</li>
 	<li>No of workers who moved to Canada since inception of Express Entry: 10,000</li>
 	<li>Application processing speed has been augmented. All applications processed under 6 months for 80% of the candidates.</li>
</ul>
On January 11, 2017, Canada rolled out 3,443 ITAs which is an unprecedented number for Express Entry Program. Trudeau's party as well as the applicants were long awaiting such a convivial event. The overall CRS (Comprehensive Ranking System) score has dwindled and reached the plinth.

“Increased scope presented by the government in its 2017 immigration plan reflects a desire to increase immigration over the coming years, and Express Entry will be the main driver of economic immigration to Canada,” said Attorney David Cohen. He also mentioned that immigration behooves Canada by filling in the void left by the plague called aging population.

The recent policy changes in Express Entry also substantiate Cohen’s point. The overall score allotted to candidates with a job confirmation has been curtailed to 50-200 range from a staggering 600. The benison of this announcement was fet across the world and especially in India. Canada’s stance to establish a quid pro quo with skilled migration applicants would be a true benediction for all the involved parties.

"Another population boom in Australia after being named the most popular country for international students.","6900","While being the most preferred destination for education among international students, Australia's immigration community continues to augment. With thousands of immigrants heading towards the island country for better prospects, Australia has witnessed the fastest growth in Net Overseas Migration (NOM) over the past 4 years.

The details of NOM have been released by Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS.) NOM is released every quarter with information regarding the total gain in the overall population through immigration. Net overseas Migration Statistics also show the impact of immigration, among other things, on Australia’s economy and culture and is also used for creating future policies by the government. Short term visit to AUstralia are not considered while compiling data for NOM.

Ms Cho, Demography DIrector for ABS said that the record high boom witnessed in 2009 was substantially more than the one witnessed now. NOM increased by 9 percent for the year ending September 30, 2016 and added 193,000 people to Australia’s population.

Further, it has been noted that Queensland has witnessed the largest growth of NOM at 19%. The overall increase for the year ending September 2016 is 348,700 which tool Australia’s population to 24.2 million.

States which saw a significant increase in population due to Net Overseas Migration:
<ul>
 	<li>Queensland</li>
 	<li>New South Wales</li>
 	<li>South Australia</li>
 	<li>Victoria.</li>
 	<li>Brisbane</li>
 	<li>Sydney</li>
</ul>
Declining NOM during 2014 and 2915 were a result of the then conservative right wing government lead by Tony Abbott. The rise in NOM delineates a positive outlook for the immigrants in Australia.

Professor Brain Salt of Curtin Business School said, ‘Australia is a young and vital nation with cities and regions still underdeveloped in comparison other nations. We will proudly remain an inclusive and generous immigrant nation for generations to come.’

He also mentioned, ‘This growth will be a source of prosperity and diversity in the future as it has been in the past. There may be times when we need to moderate flows or to direct immigration into those parts of the nation where skills and labour are most needed.’

"457 Visa Ban- Australia Follows America","6903","After Mr. Donald Trump gave his verdict on the skilled workers from foreign countries working in the United States of America, now Australian Prime Minister, Mr. Malcolm Turnbull also has tried to follow in the very same footsteps. The 457 Visa programme, that allowed Australian businesses to employ foreign workers for a period of up to four years, has been discontinued as of today.

“We are an immigration nation, but the fact remains: Australian workers must have priority for Australian jobs, so we are abolishing the 457 visa, the visa that brings temporary foreign workers into our country,"" said the Australian Prime Minister at a press conference, yesterday. Unfortunately for Indians, majority of the 457 visa holders are from the Indian subcontinent, followed by those from the UK and China.

Australia will be adopting an Australians first approach, however, that does not mean that there will be no provision for foreign nationals to get employed at Australian businesses. “It is important businesses still get access to the skills they need to grow and invest, so the 457 visa will be replaced by a new temporary visa, specifically designed to recruit the best and brightest in the national interest,"" Turnbull said.
<ul>
 	<li>The difference would be a higher number of restrictions on foreign visas and these will evidently be coming into effect starting March, 2018. These proposed changes in the visa programme, as far as can be found out are as follows:</li>
 	<li>The Temporary Skill Shortage (TSS) visa, as it will be called from now, instead of the 457 visa, will be coming into effect from March, 2018.</li>
 	<li>The Temporary Skill Shortage visa will have two streams- a short term stream, which will be valid up to two years, and a medium term stream, which will be valid up to four years.</li>
 	<li>The abolishment of the 457 visa and installation of the TSS visa in its place will most likely have a negative impact on the existing subclass visa 186.</li>
 	<li>The capacity of onshore visa renewal will be cut down to a maximum of only one, under the short term stream.
Tighter English language and Work experience requirements will be regulated.</li>
 	<li>Applicant age will be reduced to a maximum of 45 years at the time of application to procure the TSS visa to Australia.</li>
 	<li>Stricter review of Australian skilled occupation list will come into effect immediately to ensure that Australian workers are not being undercut by employers due to pay and Tax issues.</li>
 	<li>Employers will be made to pay the Australian market rate, strictly, and they must meet the Temporary Skilled Migration Income Threshold.</li>
 	<li>Collection of Tax File numbers and matching of data to Australian Tax office records will be strictly undertaken by the Department of Immigration and Border Protection.</li>
</ul>
Although most of the reforms will be coming into effect post March, 2018, The reviews will be undertaken immediately.

If planning to undertake an employment opportunity in Australia, it is advisable to connect or talk to experts about this matter immediately, so as to take the necessary decisions as well as precautions before venturing further.

He mentioned that 457 visa program served its rationale and needed to be overhauled. Furthermore, rejecting the condemnation he said that the changes were made in reaction to the policies of Pauline Hanson or US president Donald Trump.

"Coming soon - Changes in express entry this June","6929","The express entry point system will be changed this June onwards by Canada. The changes will include additional 15 points to applicants with French language skills. 30 points, for dual French and English language skills. And in the case of the sibling with Canadian citizenship or a permanent resident, the registrations with the job bank will be voluntary instead of mandatory.

Furthermore, with the removal of mandate in bank job registration, all the candidates with minimum criteria under the express entry system will be placed automatically into the pool and will be immediately eligible for the draw. Thus this may impact the on time processing’s.

The current comprehensive express entry ranking system awards applicants with 136 points for their primary language and up to 24 points for secondary official language. Due to the changes, now applicants will gain additional 15 points if the test level is at 7 of competence linguistic Canadians (NLC) with an English test result of Canadian language benchmark 4 or lesser. Applicants may earn 30 additional points for NLC level 7 test results in all the required 4 skills in French and CLB 5 or higher in English.

Additionally, with applicants siblings that are 18 years and over and living in Canada with Canadian citizenship or permanent resident, the applicant will be awarded 15 points

What our analysis say is that this change will lead to attracting francophone immigrants and with established sibling ties. The step of voluntary rather than mandatory job bank registration should ease the eligibility for invitation rounds.

"The new parent visa rules is high-priced, blackmail, unacceptable, gag says Indian Australians","6944","<p style=""text-align: justify;"">An online petition has been launched against the Australians governments’ proposal on the new parent visa. “We have to fight this. It’s a disgrace.” The members of the Indian community in Australia have termed it as a disgrace.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">According to the new parent visa it will allow migrants to seek a three year visa for their parents for a fee of $5,000, a five year visa for $10,000 and a ten year visa for $20,000. This has yet to be passed in the parliament.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">This step could gather hundreds of millions in visa fee for the government if as many as 15000 people were granted this visa each year.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Apart from this the children have to bear the health care expenses of their migrant parents and with sponsors would be legally required to pay for their private health insurance.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>The proposal was slammed by the Indian community in Australia</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Most of members of the Indian community are angered as well as disappointed by the new conditions and provisions that were revealed by Assistant Immigration Minister Alex Hawke.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">One of the residents from Melbourne, Ankit Mistry was expecting the new visa around July 2017. Now unable to bring his parents to Australia for a long stay, mentioned that the new provision is “too expensive.”</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">An Adelaide resident, Mr. Arvind Duggal who initiated the ‘Long Stay Visa for Parents’ campaign that saw national participation before the federal elections, said in Hindi:”The new visa is blackmail. We are being blackmailed into shelling out thousands to be able to live our parents. This is a lot of money plus the health care insurance.”</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Daniel Connell another member of the campaign said:” We have to fight this. It’s a disgrace.”</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">One of the community leaders in Melbourne Jasvinder Sidhu told in Hindi:” We are not happy with this change as it is exploitative and a joke with migrant communities. After the citizenship related changes this is another blow. It is also a breach of election promises which the Federal Government made because the bond money now has become fees.”</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">“There is an active element of discrimination because after paying, $10,000 for a five year twice there is no provision for renewal. During these ten years, the fees comes at $20,000 plus private health insurance would cost over $50,000 as the highest level of cover for aged parents cost $400 at least a month.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">In short this is worse than the current provision of the parent visa or permanent parent visas.”</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>People are expressing their anger on social media</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The new provisions are highly criticized by online forums.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Melbourne resident Ritesh Chugh wrote:” This is an absolute joke!! Pulling the mickey of the migrants and their parents via this proposal. Unfortunately naivety prevails. We will get altogether and voice against this proposal before it gets through.”</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">One of the other members of the community, Riken Pandejee has started a change.org petition challenging the change in the fees of long term stay visa for parents.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">In one of the online group Vishal Patel wrote,” Coming to Australia and becoming citizen of Australia shouldn’t mean we run our back on our aged parent. Australian government wants all migrants to adapt Australian values and speak fluent English...Fine but they don’t want to accept migrants as integral part of the community. They just want to use them as cash generating vehicles.”</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">During the next week budget this new provision would be announced as planned by the government.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The current system is complex and prone long delay, as per the communities that were pressuring the government for reform in the parent visas. In the response to the calls of the migrant communities the government decided to make it further intricate.</p>",,"2017-05-10 06:02:35","australian-government-announces-new-temporary-parent-visas-2017","1","publish","https://www.immigrationxperts.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/not-acceptable.png",,,"1","open","0","off","off","30","#000","0","off","0","108",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Immigration News|Australia",
"Australian Government Announces New (Temporary) Parent Visa!","6947","<p style=""text-align: justify;"">It will cost $10,000 for aged parents of migrants to get admittance to a five-year Australian visa</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Under the next week’s budget changes, Turnbull government expected to announce 15,000 new visas.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">It will cost $10,000 of an aged parent of a migrant to get access to a five-year temporary visa. This is expected to b announced in the next week’s budget.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Before the approval of the visa the parents will need to hold a private health insurance and financially supported through a bond from their children, SBS reports.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Earlier on the eve of 2016 election Turnbull government promised aged parents visas that followed by a Labour announcement that Australian parents of permanent residents and citizens will be provided with a three-year visiting visa as long as they held a private health insurance, paid a $5,000 bond and were sponsored by their children.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">In, September last year the Turnbull government released a discussion paper which had set the terms of parent visa. The assistant immigration minister, Alex Hawke, said that the program will be in place by July 2017.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The non-contributory aged parent visa has a processing time of 30 years as of now.  As per the discussion paper, 1,500 places were available at the fee cost of $5,935 for the main applicant and $4000 for their spouse and de facto partner in 2015-16</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Whereas the contributory aged parent visa is processed in two years time, however, at much higher fees of $47,295 and the fees of the main applicant of $44,845 for their spouse and de facto partner. In this category, they were 7,175 places in 2015-16.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Without an addition of extra cost to the health system, government will help families to reunite, said by the immigration minister Pete Dutton, at the time of election announcements.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">“The Coalition recognises that many Australians, including our growing south Asian and Chinese communities, face particular pressures through separation of the children from parents and grandparents, “Dutton said. “ We want to help families reunite and spend time together while ensuring we do so in a way that does not burden Australia’s healthcare system.”</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The changes in the migration come after both the Coalition and the Labor party announced crackdowns on the temporary worker visa system.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The Business Council of Australia’s chief executive, Jennifer Westacott, told recently “fear-mongering” on 457 visas did not match the evidence.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The number of eligibility categories was cut down along with 457 temporary worker visas by Malcolm Turnbull.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The establishment of “Smart visa” ensures highly skilled migrants consider Australia. On Wednesday, Bill Shorten promised to triple the cost of temporary work visa with a view of encouraging employers to look locally.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">In addition to this Westacott said data showed 457 visa holders represent about 0.8% of the total employees and just over 1% of all 457 visa sponsor engaged in serious non-compliance per year- a consistent figure over the past decade.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">She also said that Australian businesses prefer to hire Australians whenever possible because it was easier, cheaper and workers have valuable local knowledge as well as skills.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Australia’s skills base would be jeopardised by political posturing. Westacott warned during her recent debate to provide an opportunity to ensure the visa scheme had integrity and public confidence.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">“But if this becomes driven by political posturing rather than evidence, we risk jeopardising the skills base we need no power our changing and globally oriented economy,” Westacott said. “Fear-mongering around foreign workers allegedly taking Australians job is simply not matched by the data, which shows the number of primary 457 visa holders was 81,300 in December, down 5.4% from the year earlier.”</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">“If we’re serious about getting Australians into skilled jobs, we need to revitalize our neglected vocational education and training system so it’s no longer treated like poor cousins of the universities.”</p>

"New Changes for Subclass 189 Visa for 45 above Applicants and NZ Citizen","6974","<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The Australian Government has introduced some changes for the applicant under subclass 189 visas which are applying from 1st July 2017. The same mechanism also explains NZ citizens GSM Pathway on the basis of their residency in Australia for the duration of five years. This illogical announcement is really unfortunate. On one side, it’s sad news for applicants who are at the age of 45or above as they will not be able to meet the updated age requirement. On the other side, it’s good news for NZ citizen as they can easily apply for GSM pathway with minor restrictions.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""color: #000000;""><span style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;""><span style=""font-size: medium;""><b>Applicants aged 45 and above</b></span></span></span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""color: #000000;""><span style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;""><span style=""font-size: medium;"">This new rule specifies that applicants for a 189 visa reviewed from 1st July 2017 must be under the age of 45 years at the time of having an invitation to apply. Undoubtedly, it is going to apply restrictions on the permanent visa which is presently available to skilled migrants who want to move towards Australia. Applicants under the subclass 189, who had applied for immigration, will not meet the age requirement, if they are at the age of 45 or above 45 at the time of invitation. Applicants who are forced might be entitled to another visa together with Nominated permanent residence or may be permanent residence as per the Employer Nomination Scheme.</span></span></span></p>

And, to meet this obligation, an applicant will need to show or demonstrate their common residency in Australia. This common residency should have a continuous duration of at least 5 years, just before the application date. This continuous period of duration should be started in Australia either on 19th February or before 19th February 2016. Evidence such as ETO assessment needs to submit at the time of applying for the pathway.</span></span></span></p>

<ul style=""text-align: justify;"">
 	<li><span style=""color: #000080;"">Skilled Independent Subclass 189 visa maximum age will be reduced from 49 to 44</span></li>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The general skilled category maximum age is now 49 and the Skilled Independent Subclass 189 will be now reduced to 44.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><em><strong>What does the change mean? </strong></em></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The figures listed by the Department of Immigrations indicate that only 1% of the candidates for the 189 subclass are between 45 to 49 years of age at present thus the overall impact will be small. However, the people between ages of 45 to 49 years will have a significant effect as now the age limit for the permanent employer is reduced to 44.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><em><strong>Immigrationxperts.com analysis</strong></em></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">All the people between the ages 45 to 49 will be affected as the employers will now look at the age limit as 44.</p>

</ul>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">An introduction of permanent residence pathway for the NZ citizens that have worked in Australia for more than 5 years will be released.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><em><strong>What is the change?</strong></em></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The pathway will be implemented as a stream with the Skilled Independent Subclass 189 visa. This is particular could significantly make NZ citizen stream and easy method to qualify for the traditional 189 subclass.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><em><strong>What does the change mean? </strong></em></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""> The change, in particular, means that,</p>

<ol style=""text-align: justify;"">
 	<li>There would be no skill assessments. English language test, points test or any Skillselect invitation would be required</li>
 	<li>There will be no age limit</li>
 	<li>There would be concessions on the health requirements</li>
 	<li>The initials application fee will be very small</li>

<p style=""text-align: justify;""><em><strong>Immigrationxperts.com analysis</strong></em></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">60-70,000 New Zealanders are estimated to be eligible for the new stream by the Australian government.

 	<li><span style=""color: #000080;""><strong> A review on the skilled occupation list likely to be considered</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><em><strong>What is the change?</strong></em></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The expectation is that the occupations list for General Skilled Migration – the MLTSSL and STSOL – to be revised for 1 July 2017. Also, the changes to the employer sponsorship announced on 18 April has resulted in restrictions on sponsoring staff for permanent residence no longer term 457 visas, unless it is on MLSSTL.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><em><strong>What does the change mean? </strong></em></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">There would be removal of certain occupations from the list including the MLTSSL and STSOL</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><em><strong>Immigrationxperts.com analysis</strong></em></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The occupations mostly include engineering sector that is on the MLTSSL list however not on STSOL list that is unusual. There is a quite possibility that these occupations to be candidates for the removal. The Flagged Occupation List that is maintained by the department of education could also see some removal. However, as last year there could be only a few flagged occupation removals. It is also expected that there will be certain occupations removed from STSOL as well. (e.g. Human recourses advisor and a number of science and engineering occupations)</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The MLSSTL and STSOL there will be additions as there are critical occupations for the Australian business groups to lobby. This will be a good news for candidates in General Skilled Migration.</p>

"Denial Claim Procedural Fairness As The Life Saver","6986","If the application of visa has been declined, and the declination is confirmed by the Tribunal, it may be possible to have to quash of the Tribunal decision in the Federal Circuit court. It will be sent back for re-determination to the Tribunal, in the case, if it could be shown that the applicant procedural fairness did not afford by the tribunal.

The denial claim power of procedural fairness decision was illustrated which was actually handed by the Federal Circuit Court Judge Riley that paper in the February 2017. This seems as “CCM15 &amp; Ors v Minister for Immigration &amp; Anor (2017) FCCA 304 (23 February 2017)”.

Details of this case:

The applicant was looking for the grounds visa protection. A politically motivated prosecution was experienced by the applicant in their home country which would be the prosecution subject if forced to return back.

The Tribunal told the applicant at the hearing that in some relevant countries, Australian Embassy has received unidentified “dob in” letter that suspected that the applicant family member was associated with a specific political group.

Anyway, the Tribunal didn’t speak that they actually had a copy of the unidentified letter before them and didn’t give unidentified letter copy to the applicant.

The Tribunal also provides the contents summarized of the unidentified letter “dob in” by speaking applicant about the letter that she and her co-applicants were having different names. It may be that the letter had set out of the name of the applicants in two varied places with spelling variations and script.

The court accomplishes that it can be understood that there was no applicants spelling set in English. So, the fact is that there was variation in the spelling of their name in English in the translated version.

As a result, the court comes to the conclusion that the Tribunal had not given the accurate summary of the unidentified letter as they had been using varied names when this was not clear that what actually the letter said. And, further the Tribunal didn’t provide the applicant's copy of the letter, the applicants had been deprived of procedural fairness and error with jurisdiction had occurred.

It was the case for written reasons for confirming the Protection visa application refusal, the Tribunal stated that it had not placed any load on the unidentified letter.
Therefore, the Minister disputed before the court that the Tribunal had not given the unidentified letter, so the Tribunal fails to accurately explain the letter contents that have not affected the outcome of the proceedings.

Anyway, the Federal circuit court mentioned that, with the High Court’s decision for “Applicant of VEAL of 2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs” the compulsion to disclose the idea of “dob in” letters is not satisfied.",,"2017-05-29 05:25:37","denial-claim-procedural-fairness-as-the-life-saver","1","publish","https://www.immigrationxperts.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/gavel.png",,,"1","open","0","off","off","30","#000","0","off","0","66",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Immigration News|Australia",

In a bid to draw more capable applicants to Canada, Ahmed Hussen, Immigration Minister of Canada, announced certain changes in the express entry on 5th June 2017 (Monday), in the hall of Immigration Center in Markham (Ontario) informing that prospective Permanent Residency candidates can garner more points for having siblings already residing in the country and also the applicants having strong grasp over the French language will be awarded with additional points.
<a href=""https://www.immigrationxperts.com/canada-immigration-consultants/express-entry/"">Express Entry program</a>, started as an initiative to speed up the process of Permanent Resident network, works on the basis of point system awarded to an applicant as per their background, education details, training, language proficiency and work experience among other parameters. As per the changes brought in, the applicant now will also be awarded <strong>15 points</strong> for having a sibling in Canada who should be either 18 or above in age living as a Permanent Resident or as Canadian citizen. This change was decided upon as it has been analyzed that the applicants already having sibling in Canada has a much easier time in getting connected with the society of Canada.
The applicants can also garner up to <strong>30 points</strong> as per the proficiency in French deduced on the basis of their language test. These points are nowhere affected by the efficiency shown by the candidate in their English language. The reason for this change is quite simple as it has been seen that French language skilled applicants have certain ability to bring in more growth and stability to Canadian economy.
As of Tuesday, 6th June 2017, applicants will also not be asked to create on compulsory basis an account under Job Bank in the scenario where no job offer is available with them.</p>",,"2017-06-06 14:31:37","new-norms-under-express-entry-program","1","publish","https://www.immigrationxperts.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/PFC-Logo-White.jpg",,,"1","open","0","off","off","30","#000","0","off","0","75",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Immigration News|Canada",
"Canadian Positive Response Noticed Towards Canada Immigration and Diversity, Poll Says","7037","The Canadian Studies Association survey shows that 41 percent Canadian were happy for current immigration levels. This comparison is made with the 38 percent of those who says that level are too high.

This poll came into reflection when Canada just accepted over 40,000 refugees and made an announcement for sustained record level of immigration of 300,000 immigrants per year.

Canadians also express their positive responses towards the minority group. With the latest report, it has been seen that 55% detained a positive vision for Muslim in Canada. This positivity was also seen in thoughts towards Jews and aboriginals.

More than 2,500 were questioned, among which 500 were born outside the country. With the questions answers, it has been realized that there is the difference in thoughts towards immigration and multiculturalism. Major metropolitan areas of Canada respondents have positive views towards multiculturalism.

With Association for Canada studies, it was found that 80.6 percent in Hamilton-Niagara reports a very positive and positive attitude. It was lowest in Edmonton where it is about 69.7 percent who have the same views as Hamilton-Niagara.

Most of the Calgary residents about 45.5% also said about many immigrants. This trend may be possibly a result of high unemployment rate in the city and Alberta-wide province.

The responses also differ as per the people resident location and the political spectrum. More than 60 percent of these said that there were too many migrants that vary with 17 percent. These figures sometimes support the hesitant trend towards Canada acceptance increase. You can see a trend towards supporting immigration while there are also significant numbers who do not support new immigrants increase.

The poll also shows that Canadians are able to split their dislike and like for Donald Trump from their general attitude toward American. However, 66 percent reported a positive attitude for the people of the south border while 73 percent said that they don’t like their president.

This is mainly because of the fact that there are many legislative requirements that need come into effect from this date. We are now just near about this significant date. Thus below is the number of useful tips and hints that are going to assist you to be ready as to lodge visa application

<strong>Are you aware of the visa expiry date?</strong>

You can find a big traffic from 1st July when it comes to applying for an Australian visa. It may be more difficult to get an appointment to have English language exam and health checks. From all the previous record it has been seen that most of the application lodged with Immigration Department and Border Protection is highest in the month of December and June. Hence, one needs to prepare well without leaving anything before 1st July to avoid any unfavorable situation.

<strong>Time for different application criteria</strong>

Most of the Australian visas have criteria as “time of application” that may comprise of age, skills requirement, and English. It’s mandatory to fully analyze the application's requirements applicable for the subclass visa for you are applying an application. If criteria for the application do not meet, your application might be refused, as a result, there could be restrictions on the subsequent type visa in which you may not be able to apply for Australia whilst.

<strong>Fees</strong>

Every year, the Immigration Department and Border Protection of Australia updates their charges and fees. These fees and charges are published on the Immigration Department website. It is important to see visa application budget in fees especially for the visa with advanced fees such as parent and partner. If the fee is incorrect, it may result in an unacceptable application.

<strong>Additional Requirements</strong>

From 1st July, there might be new additional requirements for certain subclasses of visa. It is important to go through the requirement mentioned in your visa application. You may need to have an evidence of English with visa subclasses to score that may go high from 1st July. It means the English test result score may be insufficient from 1st July. Many applicants may get caught out with these changes as they would be having that outdated information or may be that they would not beware of the new changes.

<strong>Professional assistance</strong>

From the effects of 1st July, it is vital to have professional advice and a support from an Immigration Lawyer and a Registered Agent. It is also to observe that lodging a visa application is a “form filling” where you are paying your agent for strategy, quality assurance, advice and a peace of mind.

"Comprehensive Ranking System of Express Entry New Changes Are Now In Effect","7049","Candidates who come under Express Entry pool who already have their siblings in Canada may acquire additional points with CRS that is Comprehensive Ranking System. Other changes are going to have the involvement of the additional points, which are awarded French ability proof. These are the latest improvement under Express Entry to come from Refugees, Immigration, and Citizenship Canada. It has now become a more dynamic system of Express Entry which is the main driver to have economic immigration to Canada.

With CRS registration, there is no need of Canada JOB Bank without qualifying provincial nomination. Though, candidates may still prefer to have an entry in the Job Bank for pursuing employment opportunities with free services.

These changes announced in March, but came into effect this week and these are very few changes that were made earlier in November. At that time, IRCC changed the points awarded to CRS for a qualifying job offer with 600 to 50 or 200 points as per the position provided. The student who completed their study program was given additional points.

<strong>6th June Changes effects</strong>

In contrast of the November changes no candidates will have a decrease in their CRS points, as a direct result is introduced from 6th June. Most of the candidates will have the same points they scored while there will boost up in marks for those who have their siblings in Canada or have French ability proven.

Candidates who have already siblings in Canada will score 15 additional points while the candidates with French ability may have either 15 or 30 points. The candidates who have qualifying offer have 50 or 200 points and those who have provincial nomination will obtain 600 points.

Applying these modifications to the system, Canada’s Immigration Minister stated that Economic immigration managed via Express Entry draw highly skilled and talented immigrants which help to strengthen the economy by fulfilling the business needs.

The CRS system is dynamic as many candidates will not be affected by the latest changes as it will affect those who will get additional points and the candidates who did not see changes in score may see changes in ranking.

The CRS is a dynamic system, and though many candidates will not be directly affected by the latest changes, the introduction of new additional factors as of June

6 will shift the make-up of the pool to some degree. In that sense, the changes affect more than just those candidates who obtained additional points, as even candidates who did not see a change in their score may experience a change in their ranking.

<strong>What are the requirements to obtain the point for siblings?</strong>

As per IRCC, having siblings in Canada have shown health and social outcomes improvement by increasing a new comers’ integration with Canada.

Candidates with Express Entry pool who have a sibling in Canada will be awarded 15 additional points if a sibling is a Canadian citizen with at least 18 years of age. And, the candidates who have more siblings will also be awarded 15 points in total.

These points may also be given when the candidate’s spouse or common-law partner have also sibling in Canada. The common law partner or spouse must share partner father or mother with siblings in Canada. This relationship can be through adoption, blood, common-law partnership, or marriage.",,"2017-06-13 07:47:39","comprehensive-ranking-system-of-express-entry-new-changes-are-now-in-effect","1","publish","https://www.immigrationxperts.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Canda-Express-entry-42nd-draw.jpg",,,"1","open","0","off","off","30","#000","0","off","0","89",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Immigration News|Canada",
"Australian Government to Introduce Changes for Australian Citizenship Act","7053","The proposed changes to the Australian Citizenship Act were announced by the government in April. These changes are going to increase the duration that is only going to be applicable to the permanent resident from 12 months to 4years. It would require an applicant to demonstrate the competent proficiency level in English that would change in the government’s words. The citizenship test needed to applicants for demonstration understanding and acceptance for Australian values. It would also need to the applicants to provide evidence to show that they are now integrated with the Australian community.

The amendments that become public in the weekend would go further that may affect the Minister personal power to dominate the Administrative appeal of the override decision for the citizenship applications for the Tribunal relating. It actually enables the minister to overturn the AAT setting decision of Department for refusing the application for citizenship.

The proposed amendments will allow the minister personal powers same as it now exists under the Migration Act that enable the Minister to have a perfect decision of the AAT for visas on character grounds cancellation.

Existing laws empower the department with current subsection 21(h) for Australian Citizenship Act. It is an application for that citizenship that can be refused if the department is not satisfied with the applicant good character. Hence with the laws, the Department has authority for refusing the applicant citizenship even if the applicant has not been convicted of any criminal offense. If they are not good character interpreted with Irving and Minister for Immigration Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, it ensures moral qualities.

However, the Minister has defended to set aside the new personal power for citizenship decisions of the AAT. It claims that such decisions for Ministerial could still be appealed to the High Court. Thus, it is clear that such reviews are limited that would be restricted to examine whether the Ministerial decision to set aside or anything else.

As we have gone through many Federal courts decisions concerning to the Minister’s personal power that may cancel the non-citizens visa. Hence, it will be too difficult to manage or challenge a personal decision of the minister to set aside an AAT reversing a decision that refuses the application for citizenship.

The Law Council of Australia, President, Fiona McLeod was quoted in the news article for Sydney Morning Herald that “Any attempt to wind back review powers need to treat properly”. A lawyer who acts as a refugee was quoted that the proposed changes were totally draconian and unwanted.

The 5th position was taken up by Germany, while US, the Super Power Country, fell short of being counted in top five due to its economic propensity.

The Best Countries Survey conducted globally included about 21,000 people across the globe with about 80 countries option for the participants to choose from. Some specific criteria were set on which the countries were ranked, of which top four were
<ul>
 	<li>Stable Economy</li>
 	<li>Job Market</li>
 	<li>Quality of Income</li>
 	<li>Place I Would Live</li>
</ul>
Another criterion was the data stored in and available with World Bank and the UN (United Nations) regarding the migration population was also used to figure out the final rankings.

"Australian Visa System will be Outsourced in order to avoid Cost Blow-Outs","7254","Australian Government announced change of hands in handling immigration matters with private companies being given reign to operate visa system and immigration charges so as to avoid getting stuck with cost blow outs and also deal with influx of visitors and immigrants alike. With the country’s in season just round the corner and tourists planning for their holiday spirit the immigration department has decided to involve private companies excelling in immigration processes to tackle the tasks related to tests, corner any fraud committed and overall decision of granting the visa or not.

This shift of handling visa and its related processes over to private space is narrowed down to 10 year contract with cost of about $9 billion. The same cost is said to be distributed to some extent over immigrants and tourists via user charges, which means that cost under immigration is bound to change in near future. Another reason for this change is to streamline processes before the immigration application size increases about 50% more, as predicted, in another 9 to 10 years. As of now private sector is already involved in visa processes to an extent of 20% in total and they are likely to shoulder more responsibility in the near future.

"Australia Ranked as One of the best countries for an Immigrant","7267","A new study concluded that Australia is among the top 4 countries for immigrants. There were a number of criteria taken in account such as standard of living, economic stability, income equality and so on. Also, data published by reliable sources, such as World Bank and United nations, was also included in this study.

Sample size for the research was 21,000. Also, a few other reliable sources were included to make the research more comprehensive and conclusive. 80 countries were ranked against each other and among them Australia stood fourth. Deidre McPhillips, reported to the Washington Post that “While our methodology did not focus on refugees specifically, it did take into account immigration policies and integration measures per analysis from the United Nations.”

Australia is economically stable and offers a great standard of living to immigrants. Further, it ranks better in income equality than most countries. Australia ranked a whooping 4th and took the spot behind Sweden, Canada and Switzerland. Germany followed Australia in the rankings released by this report. Australia also has a better GDP per capita than US. Also, income inequality lead to a further downfall in rankings for US.

Though Australia’s social welfare plans do not match the standard that Sweden Adheres to, still Australia has universal healthcare and many other social welfare programs that permanent residents can avail after a few years of migrating to Australia.

Australia is also one of the best counties for receiving higher education. In fact, Australia has the highest number of international students currently. Also, Australia has relaxed their immigration procedure to attract more talented people who can make a contribution towards their economy.

<strong>Other Facts About Australia’s Economy:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Population 24,592,600</li>

"Staff Cutbacks Might Lead to Higher Waiting Period for Grant of Australian Citizenship and Visas","7277","With recent changes being brought in by the Australian government in terms of staff cut in the immigration department, the waiting period for garnering visa and Australian citizenship might increase. The main aspects of this change as stated by Mr. Mike Pezzullo, Department Secretary is:
<ul>
 	<li>The change in staff is made to overcome the under equipped units of counter terrorism.</li>
 	<li>He believes the waiting time period is affected more by the growing number of applications for visa.</li>
 	<li>Under this change about 335 staff employees have been shifted from the immigration department’s visa and citizenship area.</li>
</ul>
As per Mr. Pezzullo changes in the staff member of immigration department does not necessarily result in increase in waiting time period for the permanent migration visas along with citizenship and refugee visa. His view on the cutback is that rather than waiting time, ensuring counter-terrorism units are adept in handling in more imperative. He stated –

<strong>“</strong>If people died as a result of a terrorist attack and there was an issue around our borders, I'd be deeply concerned about that. At a human level, you don't want anyone to wait for a government decision any longer than is absolutely necessary.

These individuals will have to stay in the country for certain time period as per the news norms being explored by the department of Immigration under transformation of visas.

The report covers the segment of GDP, ratio of workers per retiree, current size of the Canada Population and total cost incurred by the health care industry. It was concluded that by raising the Canada immigration applicants to around 3,00,000, the issues faced due to aged / retired population along with low rate of birth could be greatly resolved. This suggestion was furthermore welcomed by the whole board when it was deduced that by raising the intake of immigrants into Canada will not have any untoward impact on the daily wages and income of a Canadian resident. Thus in current scenario increasing the level of immigration in Canada will not only be beneficial for the immigration aspirants but will also help to overcome certain internal issue of Canada as a country as well.

The category B of the stream is where the application will be accepted wherein the candidate do not require to show job offer but to gain eligibility they need to have sufficient work experience in the field they are applying for.
Another benefit is that prospective candidates can also opt for Provincial Nomination through the stream under NSNP (Nova Scotia Nominee Program) one of the most prestigious PNPs (Provincial Nominee Program) of Canada. As the stream is considered to be an enhanced Express Entry category, prospective candidates can garner up to 600 additional CRS (Comprehensive Ranking System) points and an opportunity to be regarded for permanent residency by acquiring ITA (an Invitation to Apply) once they are selected from the pool of candidates.

It is well known fact that Category B of Nova Scotia’s Express Entry stream is one of the most popular stream of all that gets filled up at a record breaking speed of just one day. Thus it is imperative for interested candidates to be ready with required documentation and eligibility proofs to avoid losing this opportunity.

As a government we went from 260,000 to 300,000 because of the need to meet the demands of Canadian families who wanted to reunite with their loved ones. But also employers who are asking us to allow them to continue to use immigration more and more as a way to meet their growth needs.”

There has been seen a change in the trend of bringing out Express Entry Draw. This latest draw was fourth in just three weeks which has only happened once since the Express Entry draw started in January 2015. This change is in tandem with news announced by the Canadian Government for next three years regarding the targets set for immigration on 1st November.

"10 Year Ban for Providing False Details on Australia Visa Application","7530","As per the new regulation under migration to Australia, any applicant found providing false or misleading details on their visa application, will be given a 10-year ban for entering the country. The government of Australia recently announced new rules to take into effect under which providing wrong information in your visa application, whether intentional or not, can incur a complete ban of 10 years.

These changes to the rules and regulations under <a href=""https://www.immigrationxperts.com/australia-immigration-consultants/"">Australian migration</a> are being established in order to promote the Migration Legislation Amendment (2017 Measures No. 4) Regulations 2017, that will take effect on 18th November 2017. Under the existing regulations, section 4020 of the Public Interest Criterion targets applicants who supply false documents or false and misleading information to the Australian Government in the last 12 months before an application is made.

This rule is, however, being changed to extend the period of 12 months to 10 years before applying for the visa again efficiently ensuring that the applicant cannot enter the country for another 10 years. This amendment to the old rule came into effect to stop fraud from taking place as the applicants providing such false details do not get into the country easily, as earlier they used to withdraw their application after receiving the warning from Department of Immigration and fill the form again after the period of 12 months.

It is believed by the department of immigration that individuals that have provided wrong information on their visa application are prone to provide same false details to government as well. So in the interest and safety of public it is beneficial to change this rule to ban of 10 years. The Minister of Immigration believes this change to be imperative and reasonable measure to keep the value and integrity of the Visa Framework.

""Many people knowingly provide false information. Earlier they were able to reapply after a one-year period. Now that’s being extended to ten years which effectively means they have been shut out of Australia. You are asked if you were refused a visa before and if you go to a different migration agent and he ticks ‘no’ instead of ‘yes’- if you were actually refused a visa, your prospects of getting a visa for the next ten years are gone.”

The department says officers will have discretion to determine whether or not the visa applicant has deliberately submitted fraudulent documents and applicants who accidentally provide false or incorrect information will not be subject to refusal.",,"2017-12-15 07:05:08","10-year-ban-for-providing-false-details-on-australia-visa-application","1","publish","https://www.immigrationxperts.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/07394b1a-30e8-4309-b895-8570060bea4b_1479969199.jpeg",,,"1","open","0","off","off","30","#000","0","off","0","139",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Immigration News|Australia",
"Why is Skill Select More Competitive in 2017-18?","7549","<p style=""text-align: justify;"">In comparison to earlier years, it was surveyed that the immigration invitation under SkillSelect was much more arduous this year. Such equation is similar across all the sectors and not just for pro rata jobs in the industry like IT, Engineering and Accounting. The following news looks into the trend followed under SkillSelect and basic reasoning behind the increase in the level of difficulty to garner the invitation and also to increase the chances of gaining one.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><a href=""https://www.immigrationxperts.com/australia-immigration-consultants/australia-skilled-independent-sub-class-189-visa/""><strong>Skilled Independent Visa Subclass 189</strong></a></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">This visa subclass comes under Permanent Visa wherein the applicant needs to be eligible on the basis of his own qualification, followed by work experience and then the language eligibility (English language). It does not require sponsorship or nomination by a relative, employer or state/territory government and so is an attractive option for many applicants.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Applicant cannot directly go forward for this visa (Skilled Independent Visa). Initial step is to apply an EOI (Expression of Interest) and then receive an ITA (Invitation to Apply). This ITA is sent once every two weeks in a month after the appointed official has gone through all the test results provided under General Skilled Migration Points and the score is provided for it.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">For the 189 visa subclass, applicant must nominate an occupation under IFSOL (Independent and Family Sponsored Occupations List). Occupation range are decided for in the beginning of the year for the program, which entails a maximum number of EOI invitations for each occupation in the IFSOL. The program year generally goes from 1 July to 30 June the next year.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Some occupations are very popular and receive far more eligible EOIs than the occupational ceiling. These occupations are referred to as ""pro rata"" occupations - a maximum number of invitations is set each round and so the required points may be higher or waiting time longer for these occupations. While the other ""non-pro rata"" occupations don't get anywhere near the occupation ceiling each year, and hence have a lower required points score for an invitation.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>Overall Trends for Skilled Independent Subclass 189</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">For all previous years that SkillSelect has been in operation, 60 points has been sufficient to receive an invitation for a 189 visa, unless your occupation was on the pro rata list. This year, the required score has been at least 65 and for some rounds it has been 70 points for non-pro rata occupations. As per a survey conducted for number of ITA issued in the year 2017-18 as opposed to year 2016-17 and thus easily explains why the required points score has increased for current year following observation were made:</p>

<ul style=""text-align: justify;"">
 	<li>When looking at the overall number of invitations, there have been 10,375 invitations for 189 and 489 family sponsored visas issued, against 12,021 issued ITA last year.</li>
 	<li>This is a reduction of 1,646 places or 13.6%, which could be due to places being reserved for the newly introduced New Zealand stream of the Skilled Independent 189 visa.</li>
 	<li>There's only a small change in the number of invitations issued for pro rata occupations with only a reduction of 121. Most of the reduction in places is flowing directly through to non-pro rata occupations.</li>
 	<li>So far in 2017-18, there have been 2,896 invitations issued to non-pro rata occupations, versus 4,421 to this point last year - this is a decrease of 1,525 places or 34%.<strong> </strong></li>
</ul>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>Pro Rata Occupations - Accounting</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The overall number of invitations issued to pro rata occupations has not changed much, however there is an increase in the difficulty to garner an invitation under the same. Accounting is one of the most competitive pro rata occupations and is a good illustration of what is happening.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">There was a 91% increase in the occupation ceiling for accountants in 2017-18 - normally we would expect the required points for an invitation to reduce this year.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>Applicants are Claiming Higher Points</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">One point to keep an eye on is the distribution of invitations by points score when compared to the last year program. In accordance with the survey conducted it is quite clear that there are a lot more EOIs with higher points scores than last program year. On the date 4 January 2017 round, there were approximately 350 invitations issued to people with 70 points or more, while under the round conducted on 18 October 2017 round, there were around 900 invitations issued to people with 70 points or more. About 525 people were invited with 75 points or more versus 115 or so last year.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>Points for English Language Ability</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">One of the most powering reason behind this increase in the competitiveness is that more and more applicants are acquiring high score under English language ability. It was previously unusual for applicants to gain full points for having top notch English. Many applicants are sitting for the Pearson Test of English Academic in particular and getting the points for superior English.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>Points from Other Sources</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Even with superior English, most applicants would obtain only upto 70 points. So many applicants are claiming extra points from other sources which includes:</p>

<ul style=""text-align: justify;"">
 	<li><strong>Professional Year</strong></li>
 	<li><strong>NAATI Accreditation as a Translator or Interpreter</strong></li>
 	<li><strong>Spouse Skills</strong></li>
</ul>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Even so, the increase in people claiming 75 points over the course of 2017 is staggering. This in turn points towards other factors at play.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>Over-Claiming Points</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">One possibility is that people are over-claiming points when they lodge their EOI. This may result in an invitation being issued, but to be granted a visa, you would need to be able to prove each of the points you have claimed. Failure to do so will result in refusal of the visa application, but there's nothing stopping applicants from ""spamming"" SkillSelect with EOIs which claim high points. EOI applicants over-claiming points appears to have been the cause of the high minimum score required for accountants in the 20 September 2017 round. Immigration has conducted a number of ""manual"" rounds for accountants to ensure this does not recur, but there is the possibility that over-claiming is still happening in other occupations.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>Lodging More than One EOI</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Another factor that can be possible is that a single applicant might be opting to apply for EOI more than one chance. As there is no money needed to be paid while lodging for EOI, it is quite possible for applicants to apply for more than one EOI. This can garner more invitation for applicant which will further result in less number place left for other applicants.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>Recommendations for Applicants</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Because SkillSelect is more competitive this year, it is recommended that prospective applicants aim for as high a points score as possible, which would include:</p>

<ul style=""text-align: justify;"">
 	<li><strong>English Language Ability</strong></li>
 	<li><strong>Other Points (Professional year, NAATI accreditation and spouse skills)</strong></li>
 	<li><strong>State Nomination</strong></li>
</ul>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">It is concluded that garnering ITA for SkillSelect under the year 2017-18 program is going to be  quite difficult for any prospective applicant. It has become one of the toughest part of acquiring a SkillSelect invitation through General Skilled Migration process. It is imperative thus to keep up with any new information updated under the same process. So stay tuned with us to remain on top of any details required.</p>

"Useful Information on Express Entry","7566","Express Entry is a Canadian system that selects Skilled Workers. Eligible candidates will be permitted to move in less than 6 months. More specifically, it is a method through which skilled immigrants are selected to apply for Canadian immigration.

It works more as a database called Express Entry Pool, on which the profile of eligible candidates is kept when they qualify for any of the following Federal programs:
<ul>
 	<li>Federal Skilled Worker</li>
 	<li>Canadian Experience Class</li>
 	<li>Federal Skilled Trade Worker</li>
</ul>
To qualify for the Express Entry Pool, a candidate has to be proficient in at least one of the two official languages of Canada i.e. English and French and to prove the proficiency; he has to take IELTS General Training Test.

If you have pursued your education from a foreign university, it is recommended to get your education assessed in Canada by an IRCC approved institute which will award the points for your foreign education.

Applicants accepted into Express Entry Pool will then receive points based on a Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS). This system considers the applicant's age, experience, proficiency in one of the Official languages of Canada and education. The system also considers Canadian experience while assessing the profile. The maximum points given to the applicant are 600. Your spouse profile will also be considered if you are married.

Extra points will be awarded to your profile if you have any support from a Canadian employer through (Labor Market Impact Assessment) LMIA or if you are nominated by a Canadian province.

Immigration, Refugee, and Citizenship Canada or IRCC regularly selects eligible candidates from the Express Entry Pool based on the top ranking.

On getting selected, you will receive an ""Invitation to Apply"" (ITA). Post that, you need to send your complete application package to the Canadian immigration authority within 90 days time; else your candidature will be rejected.

The application package will be dependent on your qualifying program. On receiving the application within the stipulated time, your application will be assessed by IRCC within 6 months.

On receiving approval, you will receive a Permanent Residence Confirmation from the side of IRCC. Your immigration process ends when you enter Canada as a Canadian immigrant.

"Total 638 Candidates are invited in the Latest Draw Conducted by Manitoba Province to apply for provincial nomination","7573","<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>253 out of 638 were Express Entry candidates who were invited</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Reflecting to the latest draw made in 13<sup>th</sup> March 2018, the Manitoba province has issued 638 invitations to apply for a provincial nomination. 258 out of 638 invitations were authorized to the candidates from the federal Express Entry category.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Total 253 Letters of Advice to Apply (LAAs) was issued by <a href=""https://www.immigrationxperts.com/canada-immigration-consultants/provincial-nomination-program/"">Manitoba’s Provincial Nominee Program (MPNP)</a> to the Express Entry candidates who possessed a job seeker validation code along with minimum six months of latest experience in an occupation mentioned on the MPNP. Also the occupation should be in high demand in the Occupations List.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The minimum score for a <a href=""https://www.immigrationxperts.com/canada-immigration-consultants/express-entry/"">Express Entry</a> candidate invited under Manitoba’s Expression of Interest (EOI) is 545. This minimum EOI score has further curtailed by 15 points over the prior draw via the MPNP’s new Express Entry sub-stream, and 20 points less than the inauguration draw of the sub stream conducted on January 11.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">In the Skilled Workers in Manitoba Stream 184 candidates were issued LAAs, to the candidates having an EOI ranking score of 545 that is the minimum score. Also a total of 144 candidates in the Skilled Workers Overseas Stream were issued LAAs. And the minimum score a candidate in this group has an EOI ranking score of 590.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Fulfillment Criteria of the Candidates:</p>

<ul style=""text-align: justify;"">
 	<li>Having a Manitoba based relative or prior education or Manitoba work experience;</li>
 	<li>Declaration of regional destination;</li>
 	<li>Six months of latest work experience in an occupation on Manitoba’s Occupations list that are in high demand; and</li>
 	<li>At least CLB 5 for language eligibility and primary work experience in a monitored occupation (at least 7) or a compulsory occupation (CLB 6).</li>

"Double immigration target is set for Newfoundland and Labrador, said the Federal minister.","7576","<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Seamus O’Regan targets around 4,000 newcomers this year and he said, “We are ready to make this happen”.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The federal cabinet minister of the province of<a href=""https://www.immigrationxperts.com/canada-immigration-consultants/newfoundland-and-labrador-provincial-nominee-program-nlpnp/""> Newfoundland and Labrador</a> has set more than double immigration target. He serves as the Canada’s Minister of Veteran Affairs and the Member of the Parliament for a riding in Newfouldlands’s capital city St. John’s, said that he has a recent buy-in from the Canada’s immigration Minister, Ahmed Hussen. This step is taken to increase the province’s prevailing immigrant status of 1,700 newcomers to around 4,000 by the year 2022.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">In the recent meeting of the St. John’s Board of Trade this week, Seamus O’Reganspoke about his recent conversation with Immigration Minister Ahmed Hussen, “I was just on the phone with my friend, Somali refugee-turned Immigration Mister Ahmed Hussen, and we are ready to make this happen”. It is estimated that, with the combination of the outmigration and the current population status, which is declining “at the incredible rate”, the 4,000 new immigrants will maintain balance of the baseline and prevent them from adversely affecting the social conditions of Newfoundland and Labrador’s declining tax support from going bad to worse.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">“We need a minimum of 4,000 new immigrants a year in this province just to maintain the status quo. But, I’m not interested in maintaining the status quo. I’m interested in growing this economy, I’m interested in more jobs, in higher profits, in increased prosperity – and that means more immigrants. A lot more.”, were the words spoken by the Federal Minister of Newfoundland and Labrador.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The Government of Newfoundland and Labrador recently predicted that by the year 2025, there will be a decline of 10 percent in its working age population, which will result in 35,000 less people in the provincial labour market. There has been a steady increase in the numbers of the newcomers in the past few years, i.e. the total number of immigrants has increased from 546 in 2007 to 1,122 in year 2015.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">O’Regan said that, “Once people come here, they are welcomed into our communities, they are welcomed into our homes, and they are often welcomed into our hearts”. He took pride in sharing the recent Canadian survey of immigrants, where St. John’s is mentioned among the most open and welcoming cities in the country.</p>",,"2018-03-09 18:19:26","double-immigration-target-is-set-for-newfoundland-and-labrador-said-the-federal-minister","1","publish","https://www.immigrationxperts.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/800px-Newfoundland_and_Labrador_in_Canada.svg.png",,,"1","open","0","off","off","30","#000","0","off","0","56",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Immigration News|Canada",

"The Requirements of Express Entry Canada","7692","Canada immigration Express Entry System identifies the possible immigrants that can significantly contribute to the economy of Canada. This system is designed by CIC (Citizenship and Immigration Canada). The system finds the eligibility based on Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS) which is actually a point-based structure. Canada Express Entry Comprehensive Ranking System is designed to award points to the profile of the candidate for the factors like educational qualification, work experience, language proficiency, age, Adaptability, etc.

So, you must be thinking what is the minimum point requirement of the <a href=""https://www.immigrationxperts.com/canada-immigration-consultants/express-entry/"">Canada Immigration Express Entry</a> to receive an ITA? Well, there is no minimum CRS score requirement as such for the candidate who is applying under Canada Express Entry System. But, for being selected from the pool of Canada Express Entry, you are required to score really high among other profiles. So, Immigration Xperts suggests you keep checking the trend of the recently held Express Entry draws. If your CRS score is below the score selected for the ITA, you have to work on increasing your score. On satisfying the eligibility criteria of minimum point requirement, you are all set to create your Express Entry profile. To be a potential candidate in the Express Entry pool, you need to work on below-mentioned factors.
<ul>
 	<li>Age (maximum 110 points)- Candidates in their twenties can claim the highest points</li>
 	<li>Level of Education (maximum 150 points) - System rewards maximum points for an outstanding educational qualification.</li>
 	<li>Language Proficiency (maximum 160 points)- Candidate gets maximum points if he shows his English language proficiency in</li>
 	<li>speaking, listening, reading and writing.</li>
 	<li>Canadian Work Experience (maximum 80 points) - Former Canadian work experience can make you earn good points.</li>

Another change in this dimension is the cost of fuel and petrol which is highest in Northern Territory at the rate of 183.9c per litre (unleaded petrol) that is at an average of 138.9c per litre for the rest of the country.

"Time to Focus on Who we’re bringing In rather than number of immigrants : Peter Dutton","7721","<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Peter Dutton, Home Affairs Minister of Australia wants the government to concentrate not on number but on the immigrants being brought into the country. According to Dutton, it would be better to focus on immigrants who can easily integrate in the Australian society. Also, he wants them to move to cities other than Sydney and Melbourne.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The local population of Sydney is already being displaced by the immigrants. Rising inflation has made it hard, especially for young people, to afford housing and other basic amenities in cities like Sydney and Melbourne.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Dutton said, “I think, frankly, the more productive debate is around who we’re bringing in, whether or not they’re the right people, are they integrating? Are they working hard, paying taxes? And nobody begrudges that... As long as you bring the right people in, I think that’s the priority and we’ve taken decisions about cutting the numbers back from where they were under Rudd and Gillard, and Bill Shorten, as I say, is proposing to increase the number of refugees that we bring in each year by quite a dramatic number.”</span></p>",,"2018-05-02 17:09:47","time-to-focus-on-who-were-bringing-in-rather-than-number-of-immigrants-peter-dutton","1","publish","https://www.immigrationxperts.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/200f0e149f60bd647b63d8ae79615ea7.jpg",,,"1","open","0","off","off","30","#000","0","off","0","32",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Immigration News|Australia",

Last year, it was reported that 18,000 residents of Sydney had left the town in order to make room for immigrants from all over the world. The rising prices of housing and basic amenities is the underlying reason behind locals leaving Sydney.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Also, due to high number of immigrants, the average salaries have depleted, leading to further destabilization of the labour market. Most locals who left Sydney headed straight for Melbourne.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Leith van Onselen, the chief economist with MacroBusiness said, They’re pushing people out.‘’ He also said, “The cost of housing in Sydney has obviously gone through the roof, it’s one of the most expensive places to live in the world.

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The department has recently announced that the changes in the invitation pattern.
As we know previously, the department of home affairs was conducting <strong>2 invitation rounds every month</strong>(2<sup>nd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> Wednesday) ,which was every fortnight.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">In this change, DHA has assured that although there will be less number of rounds each month, there will be no change in the number of invitations issued each month but again this can change the pattern leaving many aspirants waiting for invitations longer.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">As long as they maintain the invitation number each month, it would be fine but the moment it drops down, applicant can expect longer delays.</p>

"CRS minimum score drops to 441 in new Express Entry draw","7828","The Government of Canada issued 3,750 invitations to apply for Canadian permanent residence in a new Express Entry draw held on Wednesday, July 25. The Comprehensive Ranking System cut-off score for this invitation round was 441.
<span id=""more-10952""></span>

The minimum Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS) score in today’s draw is one point lower than the last invitation round on July 11, when the CRS cut-off score was 442.

The score reduction could be attributed to the back-to-back draws of 3,750 ITAs in a 14-day period.

The tie-break date and time used in this draw was December 31, 2017, at 12:14:21 UTC. This means that all candidates with a CRS score above 441, as well as those candidates with scores of 441 who submitted their profile before this specified date and time, received an ITA in this invitation round.

This is the fourth consecutive draw to issue 3,750 Invitations To Apply (ITA) and brings the total ITAs issued in July to 7,500. This makes July 2018 by far the best July in terms of ITAs issued since Express Entry was introduced in 2015 and follows a record-setting month of June, which also saw 7,500 ITAs issued.

As of today, however, IRCC is still behind last year’s ITA total at this time.

"Citizenship Minister Acknowledges Perks to Migrants in the Rural Regional Areas","8053","A blend of fresh visa environment and brand new enticement was acknowledged by the Turnbull government to stimulate the migrants to settle permanently in the regional and rural areas, as per Alan Tudge – the citizenship minister. Mr Tudge has been encouraging the changes to hold on the migrants since May. Specific visas have been designed to allure the skilled workers from worldwide to the regions. But the home affairs data unveiled in the close Senate hearing brought out the fact that 10% of those migrants were immigrating to the cities within the period 18 months.

So it is a matter of concern and a question mark that the similar perks will be provided further to the new migrants who want to move to the tiny states like South Australia according to Mr Tudge. With that add on scenarios to those visas the migrant can peacefully reside for few years, where they make their permanent home prior becoming a citizen. The Turnbull government states that it is looking forward for growth in the regional population, with developing economies reducing the pressure from Sydney and Melbourne. There are many parts of the country who want population growth and more jobs to support the same – Mr Tudge added. The reforms and reports of the regional visas of Australia can associate a broad population policy that will soon to cabinet.

"Australia Migrant Council Hints Regional Advance of New Arrivals","8232","The migrant council of Australia has supported alertness against the strong growing advance of the entry of the new migrants to the regional areas, considering it might stunt economic growth. The immigration Minister David Coleman stated that he is closely observing to accord incentives and streamline the visa process to invite more migrants to shift to the important cities outside. The Australia Prime Minister Scott Morrison has indicated plans last to moderate the admission of temporary migrants and to stimulate the new arrivals to come and settle in the regional areas.
The main reason behind the move is that it comes to the major cities: Sydney and Melbourne and these cities are already going through the pressure of an overcrowded population and congestion.

Mr. Coleman states providing strong possible reasons to the immigrants to shift to the regional areas and ensure that they will stay whenever they want. He stated to the Sky News last Sunday - ""I don't want to get into specifics about particular visas and so on ... but what I would say is that it's about creating the right structure"". ""So the right incentives, the right reasons for immigrants to choose those regional areas.""It's also about ensuring that that's followed through upon. Obviously, if people come on a visa that's meant to be based in a regional area then compliance needs to be there to make that happen.""
The Australian Migration Council Chief Executive Carla Wilshire stated that the proofs show that the migrants who have settled in the regional areas are doing pretty well. The chief executive, Wilshire also added that there are many immigrants who possess experience in specific skills that were used best in the urban areas. Almost 87 percent of skilled migrants shift to Melbourne or Sydney.
Ms. Wilshire said to AAP ""Migration is immensely important to Australia's economic future and we need to be careful not throw the baby out with the bath water"".""A migration program that addresses the requirements of regional Australia does not solve basic infrastructure problems”. ""If we are going to continue to grow and stay competitive then we need to make the investment in infrastructure in our cities.""
There are many regions in Australia that have been inviting the immigrants that comprise South Australia, the Goldfields in Western Australia and Victoria's Warrnambool the immigration minister Mr. Coleman added.
