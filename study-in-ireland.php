                <p class="about-one__text-2">An international student has to choose between on-campus or off-campus
                    accommodation. Both have their benefits and drawbacks. However, it solely depends on the student to
                    choose any to their preference and budget. On-campus accommodation can cost up to â‚¬4,000 to â‚¬6,000
                    (INR 3.5-5 Lakhs) annually i.e. â‚¬500 (INR 42,000) monthly, excluding the other expenses. Whereas the
                    cost of off-campus accommodation is less than the on-campus one, it can cost up to â‚¬3,000 (INR 2.51
                    Lakhs) annually for a shared room.</p>
