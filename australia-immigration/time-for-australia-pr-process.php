                            <p class="about-one__text-2">In this particular duration, you can expect a case officer from
                                the Immigration Department of Australia to contact you for various queries. This could
                                take place at around 5.5. months as they might ask for more documents that are required

                                Once the case officer would contact you, your application will be kept on hold until all

                                is directly linked with your ANZSCO job code and the total number of points that you
                                have scored on the <a href="https://www.immigrationxperts.com/australia-immigration/australia-immigration-points-system/">Australian immigration points system</a> for Skilled Visa Class. <br>
                                Applicant that are able to score 65 points or higher have great chances of receiving an
                                invitation to apply (ITA). Here, therefore, individuals that have more than 70 points
                                have a realistic chance of getting an invite but it also keeps on changing every
                                subsequent month or with every new draw that takes place on the 11th day.</p>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2">The waiting time to receive an invitation to apply (ITA) can
                                vary from a minimum one month to twelve months but for other occupations it could be
                                long as well. Also, please note that the Australian PR processing time begins once your
                                SkillSelect Expression of Interest (EOI) has been called for an invite by the Department
                                of Home Affairs (DHA) and you have paid the required processing fee. <br>
                                For instance, Software Engineer (Occupation Code: 261313) that have a total score of 75
