                            <p class="about-one__text-2">Australia provides opportunities to all those who want to
                                immigrate and stay there with its culturally diverse culture and growing economy.
                                Australia now has almost 22 million inhabitants and its population is constantly
                                growing. Nearly twenty-five percent of its population is made up of non-Australian
                                citizens, reflecting the enormous immigration rate in the country.</p>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2">Recognizing many advantages of moving to Australia may explain
                                the reason behind huge immigration rate. With a high living standard and a healthy
                                lifestyle backed by a strong economy and beautiful landscaping, Australia is the best
                                immigration option in comparison to other countries. Citizens are heading to Australia
                                for a better life.</p>

">Australian immigration</a> department provides an opportunity to
                                skilled and talented people to work or settle within the country.Australia has an
                                immigration policy that is effective, tried and trusted and well-designed. Australia is
                                an attractive destination in the 21st century for business development and growth.
                                Because of the availability of huge natural resources and the rapidly evolving economy,
                                it is a suitable country for entrepreneurs and investors.</p>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2">The nation faced no work problems during the global market
                                downturn. Above all, you will also appreciate the connection with nature that is a need
                                for a healthy lifestyle. Hundreds of applicants are admitted for education and
                                employment in Australia every year.<br>
                                Australia provides its residents with high living standards. Country has effective and
                                fast transportation facilities to cover large distances between cities. Via transport
                                routes, all cities are very well linked. Immigrants can fly to Australia easily and
                                conveniently. Country offers world-class restaurants with a wide range of choices for
                                those who love eating.</p>
                                <!-- <p><a href="https://www.immigrationxperts.com/canada-immigration/canada-comprehensive-ranking-crs-points-calculator/"><b>Also Read: </b>Canadian CRS Calculator for Skilled Immigration</a></p> -->
                            <p class="about-one__text-2">In comparison to other countries, Australia offers high quality
                                and reasonably priced accommodation. Australia provides the spouses of professional
                                funded workers with both temporary and permanent entry visas with unhindered labor
                                rights. Skilled workers, students, entrepreneurs and seekers of pleasure all benefit
                                from migrating to Australia in multiple ways. So many benefits draw lots of immigrants
                                from different countries to Australia.<br>
                                Permanent residents can also sponsor their relatives for acquisition of permanent
                                residence.</p>

                            <h2 class="txt mt-4">Why Benefits?</h2>
                            <h5 class="txt mt-4">Job opportunities</h5>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2">Few nations can really match Australia's impressive appeal to
                                qualified overseas workers, which has a dramatically low unemployment rate. The country
                                is aggressively accepting migrants with job skills to fill their many job vacancies and
                                contribute to the nation's economic prosperity. Within four months of moving to the
                                country, more than 80 out of 100 migrants with qualified independent visas get work.</p>

                            <h5 class="txt mt-4">Freedom to Work</h5>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2">The next major aspect of permanent residence is the work permit
                                aspect. Permanent residents in any profession may work for any employer. But it is
                                strictly limited for Australian citizens to serve in the Public Service and Armed
                                Forces. Nevertheless, this does not differentiate between permanent residents and
                                citizens the industrial rules. Under these rules, permanent residents reap the same
                                privileges as citizens.</p>

                            <h5 class="txt mt-4">Healthcare benefits</h5>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2">Citizens enjoy the right to healthcare. As a permanent resident
                                in Australia, you have the benefit of a government-run health insurance scheme called '
                                Medicare which provides free medical treatment at discounted rates in government
                                hospitals and medicines. Permanent residents will have access to the government-run
                                Medicare health insurance program right. You can get free treatment at government
                                hospitals as well as subsidized medication through this.</h5>
                            <h5 class="txt mt-4">Flexible guidelines on immigration</h5>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2">Down Under provides the unrestricted professional workers with
                                permanent and temporary entry visas with unlimited job opportunities. There is no
                                limitation on the amount of visas that can be made available through the temporary entry
                                system to professionals and other skilled immigrants. In contrast to other countries,
                                the Kangaroo Land also boasts relatively more versatile and efficient temporary entry
                                arrangements.</p>

                            <h5 class="txt mt-4">Geographical Surroundings</h5>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2">Let's first take the climate! Down Under boasts an
                                unprecedented natural beauty and has plant and animal species that are exclusively
                                indigenous to their soils. The warm weather all year round makes it a perfect place for
                                outdoor culture, even as it is commonly expressed in its people's active lifestyle. For
                                this reason, migrants who are keen to live a full life consider the nation only fine.
                                The country also has some of the most impressive wildlife reserves in the world, some of
                                which are known as national parks.</p>
                            <h5 class="txt mt-4">Excellent Culture</h5>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2">To culturally sensitive refugees, again few nations can equal
                                Australia's unprecedented appeal, which is primarily an immigrant-friendly nation with
                                over 30 percent of its immigrant population. The nation boasts a rich arts community
                                kaleidoscope, some of the common activities being theatre, concerts, art exhibits, films
                                and cultural carnivals. Adding to the nation's appeal is the fact that it undoubtedly
                                produces some of the best wine and food and its quality, and the rich cultural diversity
                                of its citizens, shines widely through its many world-famous restaurants, strategically
                                located across the country's length and breadth.</p>

                            <h5 class="txt mt-4">Quality Living Standards</h5>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2">The nation boasts a higher-standard housing. Nonetheless, it's
                                pretty affordable to equate the same with other similar nations. Schools, hospitals and
                                public transportation in the country display the exceptionally high standard of living
                                enjoyed by those who live in the country.</p>
