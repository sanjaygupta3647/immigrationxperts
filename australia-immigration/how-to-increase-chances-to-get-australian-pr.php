                            <p class="about-one__text-2">Australia is one of the most prominent immigration destinations
                                among global migrants. It is largely being perceived as homeland of humanity, justice
                                and equality. In a recent announcement made by the Australian Government, the country
                                has proposed to invite more than 1 million individuals on Skilled Immigrant Visa by the
                                end of 2021.<br>This Permanent Resident (PR) Visa issued by the Australian Government to
                                skilled and talented international workers is totally based on a points system.</p>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2">Points or Score across each of the factors, across which more
                                points are awarded to a potential candidate on the Australian Point System are closely
                                been inspected and some of those factors or components have been recognized using which
                                the more points can be gained. This in allows the candidate to increase their chances to
                                get an Australian Permanent Resident (PR) visa.</p><br>

                            <p class="about-one__text-2">Although an applicant can score points on a range of factors
                                such as age, education qualification, work experience, English language proficiency
                                along with other factors which makes them eligible towards Australian Immigration.
                                However, in addition to these factors, an applicant can score more points if he/she
                                could focus on the criteria described below, which is completely based on the current
                                Points Test System of the General Skilled Migration Scheme for Australian under Subclass
                                189 and 190 visas.</p>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2">By following the steps described alongside each of the factors
                                described below, the total number of points on the <a href="https://www.immigrationxperts.com/australia-immigration/australia-immigration-points-system/">Australian Points System</a> can be
                                increased. These are:</p>
                            
                            <p class="about-one__text-2"><span>Spouse Skill Assessment: </span>If your spouse or
                                partner, aged 45 years or less also undergoes skills assessment and an additional 5
                                points will be awarded towards your overall score â€“ provided they have competent level
                                of English proficiency (overall 6 in IELTS and 59 in PTE) and are skilled in an
                                in-demand occupation.</p>

                                <a href="https://www.immigrationxperts.com/australia-immigration/estimated-cost-in-australia-pr-process/">Australian Permanent Residence</a>. You will need to achieve an IELTS band score equivalent
                                to 8 across all components and PTE band score equivalent to 79 across all components as
                                this will give you an additional 20 points, which is same as having a doctorate degree.
                            </p>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2"><span>Move to a regional area:</span>Getting an invitation to

                                (if applying under visa Subclass 189). However, if you get selected in a regional area,
                                which are categorized opposite to a metropolitan or are low populace area then you will
                                be awarded with additional 15 points (if applying under visa Subclass 491).</p>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2"><span>Work Experience:</span>Employed in an occupation which is
                                in coherence with your academic qualification will ensure deduction of any extra points
                                and will therefore increase your overall chances to get an Australian permanent
                                residence.</p>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2"><span>Gain meaningful employment: </span>The more years of

                                the Skilled Occupation List (SOL), the greater number of points you gain towards your
                                Australian permanent resident application. Therefore, you are being suggested to gain
                                some extra and meaningful job experience in order to gain extra points on your total
                                employment experience.</p>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2">Please note that one year of full-time work experience across
                                Australia can grant you a total of five additional points. In addition to this, previous
                                employment, gained overseas can also help you earn additional points.</p>

                            <p class="about-one__text-2"><span>Australian Exposure:</span>You can increase your total

                                relevant Australian Study Requirement or a Specialist Education Qualification. In
                                addition to this, if you have completed your studies from a university or college
                                located in Regional Australia then you will be awarded with extra points in your
                                profile.</p>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2"><span>Language Accreditation: </span>Gaining accreditation in a

                                are awarded with extra 15 points under Subclass 190 and 491 visas.</p>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2">Even after taking into consideration all the above factors, you
                                are still short of 5 points towards submitting an application, then we have some great
