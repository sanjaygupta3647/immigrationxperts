                            <h1 class="section-title__title">SINP - Farm Owner and Operator Stream</h1>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2">One of Saskatchewan’s PNP streams is dedicated to supporting
                                entrepreneurs who want to own and run farms there.</p>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2">The Farm Owner and Operator stream of the Saskatchewan
                                Immigrant Nominee Programme (SINP) is examined in depth in the following guide. The
                                overview of the stream, its eligibility conditions, its operation, the required
                                documentation, its cost, and processing times are covered in the guide.</p>
                            <h5 class="txt mt-4">Detailed description of the farm owner and operator stream</h5>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2">One of the three Saskatchewan PNP streams devoted to foreign
                                businesspeople looking to invest their money in the territory is the Farm Owner and
                                Operator (FOO) stream.</p>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2">Candidates who are nominated through the FOO stream can then
                                apply to the Canadian government for permanent residence.</p>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2">Candidates cannot benefit from Express Entry’s six-month
                                average processing timeframes since this stream is not Express Entry-aligned. Provincial
                                Nominee Programme processing timelines, which are not in line with Express Entry, are
                                often longer and require at least a year.</p>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2">While a legitimate job offer is not a primary condition for the
                                FOO stream (or its Young Farmer sub-stream), there are additional qualifying
                                requirements that must be met, including those relating to investments and personal net
                                worth, which are covered in more depth below.</p>
                            <h5 class="txt mt-4">Conditions for Eligibility</h5>
                            <p class="about-one__text-2">Young Farmer is a substream of the Farm Owner and Operator
                                stream. There are different eligibility conditions for each, but they are all rather
                                comparable. If you meet all of the qualifications listed below, you may apply:</p>

                                will be refunded to you. The deposit will be forfeited to Saskatchewan if the conditions

                                by wire transfer. To determine their net worth and legal accumulation of wealth, the

                                at least five business days. The candidate is anticipated to meet with service experts
                                during this trip in order to undertake in-depth study on the farming community and
                                industry in Saskatchewan. Finally, while in Saskatchewan, candidates are expected to
                                speak with a SINP official about their planned agricultural operation.</p>

                                application is accepted for nomination. The candidate must sign the Business Performance
                                Agreement. By doing this, he or she pledges to buy and actively run a farming enterprise
                                in Saskatchewan. Regarding the conditions of the performance agreement, the letter will
                                include instructions on how to submit the necessary refundable $75,000 CAD good faith
                                deposit.</p>
